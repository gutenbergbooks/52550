<h2 class="main">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">An attempt to write the history of Christianity in
the space of an average novel is so obviously open to objections that,
instead of trying to parry them, I will merely state what seems to me
the possible compensation of brevity in such a matter. It is or may be
conducive to total comprehension, to coherence of judgment, and in a
measure even to the understanding of details. A distinguished expert in
historical and philological research has avowed that specialists
sometimes get their most illuminating ideas from a haphazard glance
into a popular and condensed presentment of their own subject. Without
hoping so to help the experts, I humbly conceive that the present
conspectus of Christian history may do an occasional service even to an
opponent by bringing out a clear issue. Writers of a different way of
thinking have done as much for me.</p>
<p class="par">The primary difficulty is of course the problem of
origins. In my treatment of this problem, going as I do beyond the
concessions of the most advanced professional scholars, I cannot expect
much acquiescence for the present. It must here suffice to say, first,
that the data and the argument, insofar as they are not fully set forth
in the following pages, have been presented in the larger work entitled
<i>Christianity and Mythology</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e936src"
href="#xd21e936" name="xd21e936src">1</a> or in the quarters mentioned
in the Synopsis of Literature appended to this volume; and, secondly,
to urge that opponents should read the study on the Gospels by
Professor Schmiedel in the new <i lang="la">Encyclop&aelig;dia
Biblica</i> before taking up their defensive positions. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e945" href="#xd21e945" name=
"xd21e945">x</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">One of the drawbacks of short histories is that in them
at times a disputable proposition has to be summarily put. I doubt,
however, whether this occurs oftener in the following pages than in
lengthy treatises, where full discussion is fairly to be expected. For
instance, I have held that the reference in <a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%202:8">Rev. ii,
8</a>, to &ldquo;the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are
not, but are a synagogue of Satan,&rdquo; is to the Pauline or other
Gentilizing Jew-Christists. That is the view of Renan. Harnack, who
passes for a more solid authority, pronounces summarily that the phrase
is cast by Jew-Christists at orthodox Jews. Such a decision seems to me
to be irrational, but it is impossible in such a work to give space to
a refutation, where Harnack has offered no argument on the other side
in a monumental treatise. The same authority has justified masses of
conformist historiography by the simple dogmatic assertion that the
time is near at hand when men will universally recognize, in matters of
Christian origins, &ldquo;the essential rightness of tradition, with a
few important exceptions.&rdquo; In putting forth a sketch which so
little conforms to that opinion, I would but claim that it is not more
unjudicial in its method than more conservative performances.</p>
<p class="par">After the period of &ldquo;origins&rdquo; has been
passed, there is happily less room for demur on any grounds. The
statements of facts in the second and third parts are for the most part
easily to be supported from the testimony of standard ecclesiastical
historians; and the general judgments sometimes cited in inverted
commas, in all four parts, are nearly always from orthodox writers.
What is special to the present treatise is the sociological
interpretation. It was indeed to the end of such interpretation that
the researches here summarized were begun, over sixteen years ago; and
in a documented work on <i>The Rise of Christianity, Sociologically
Considered</i>, I hope more fully to present it. But as my first
perplexity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e956" href="#xd21e956"
name="xd21e956">xi</a>]</span>was to ascertain the real historical
<i>processus</i>, I have never subordinated that need to the desire for
explanation.</p>
<p class="par">It hardly needs actual experience of the risks of error
and oversight in a condensed narrative to convince one of the
difficulty of escaping them. Where no single authority is found
infallible, I must at times have miscarried, were it only because I
have aimed at something beyond a condensation of current accounts. No
criticism, therefore, will be more highly valued by me than one which
corrects my errors of fact.</p>
<p class="par">In order to cover the ground within the compass taken,
it was absolutely necessary to digest the subject-matter under general
heads; and the chronological movement may in consequence be less clear
than in histories which proceed by centuries. As a partial remedy,
dates have been frequently inserted in the narrative, and it is hoped
that the full index will help to meet the difficulty which may
sometimes be felt as to where a given name or episode should be looked
for.</p>
<p class="par">It is perhaps needless to add that the appended Synopsis
of Literature does not in the least pretend to be a bibliography for
professed students. It is designed merely as a first help to
painstaking readers to search and judge for themselves on the problems
under notice.</p>

<h2 class="main">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the dozen years that have passed since this
book was written there has probably been some change in the outlook of
the more critical of the readers to whom it might be said to be
addressed. It challenges criticism on two main issues: that of
Christian origins, and that of the sociological interpretation of
Christian history. Twelve years ago, the thesis of the non-historicity
of the gospel story in respect of its &ldquo;natural&rdquo; no less
than of its supernatural matter found few serious listeners, even among
Rationalists; while the strictly naturalistic study of Christian
history incurred a good deal of resentment. To-day, perhaps, the thesis
as to origins may receive more attention; while the historic narrative
may arouse less impatience. On both issues, critical thought appears to
be at work.</p>
<p class="par">The primary problem may be left to the fortunes of
discussion: the question as to how Christian history is fitly to be
presented in summary is perhaps worth some introductory treatment.</p>
<p class="par">An attentive reading of the reviews of the first edition
left the author impressed by the fact that censure was generally passed
without any attempt to prove error of statement. Error there may well
have been; but it was not pointed out or founded on in the hostile
judgments passed by religious reviewers. One German Catholic
ecclesiastic was ironical at great length on the account given of the
history of the Catholic Church; but he did not seem to impugn any
particular historical statement. More serious reviewers made
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e982" href="#xd21e982" name=
"xd21e982">xiv</a>]</span>nothing clear save that they resented the
selection made of facts and the summing-up from these. So far as the
author could gather, they claimed that another set of data should have
been given, and another general impression set up. If he understood
them aright, they held that the way to write Christian history is to
look for all the utterances of good feeling, all the instances of
humane action, all the items of political, social, and intellectual
betterment that have occurred in the Christian era, and to call the
general statement of these&mdash;with, of course, a sympathetic account
of doctrinal evolution&mdash;a history of Christianity. The things on
the other side of the shield&mdash;the religious wars, the consecration
of error, the strangling of truth, the persecutions, the propagandist
massacres, the countless cruelties wrought in the name and on the
sanction of the faith&mdash;are from this point of view external to its
history: things to be set down to the perversity of men. All the good
that has happened is to be credited to Christianity; all the bad to
human nature.</p>
<p class="par">It seems necessary to explain that this is a wholly
puerile conception of historical science, and that the notion of
historical causation so reached is profoundly false. Impartially
applied, the method would yield equivalent panegyric for all religions
alike. All that is beautiful and heroic in pre-Christian and
non-Christian history would be shown to be due to the creeds of the
different times and races; all the harm would be set down, as before,
to human nature. The rational statement is that human nature evolved
all the religions in turn; that creeds, once established, become
special factors; that their varying fortunes are due to the reciprocal
reactions of creed and environment; and that to write the history of
any one religion it is necessary to consider narrowly how it
specifically reacts on conduct in given circumstances of culture and
socio-political structure. If it can be shown specifically to promote
right action on any line, let that be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e986" href="#xd21e986" name="xd21e986">xv</a>]</span>duly credited
to the religion in question as the determinant. If, on the other hand,
it can be shown to promote wrong action, the fact must on the same
principle be put to its discredit. But no Christian historian, broadly
speaking, ever thinks of crediting to Greek polytheism the fairer
aspects of Greek life, or to Islam the virtues of veracity and courage
sometimes ascribed to Turks and Arabs; though professedly Christian
historians have been known to contrast the comparative decency of the
execution of Sokrates with the savage horrors of political executions
in Christendom down to recent times.</p>
<p class="par">Aristotle and Plato are still founded on for the
purposes of higher education in Christian countries; but no Christian
writer suggests that what is good or true in their thought is
ascribable to paganism <i>qua</i> paganism; though modern ethical
development is constantly set down to the score of Christianity. In the
same fashion, hospitals in Christian countries are constantly credited
to the Christian account, without a thought of admitting that Moslem
hospitals are the product of the Koran, or that the mutual helpfulness
of Eskimos is a specific result of their heathenism. Paganism is made
to figure in general as promoting vice and human sacrifices and
slavery; Christianity as putting these things down. The impartial
historian pronounces that it has indeed beneficently availed for the
suppression of human sacrifice in general, in virtue of its primary
dogma; but that <i>qua</i> religion it has no more told against slavery
than has Islam; that the slavery maintained till last century under
Christian sanctions and auspices has been as cruel as any seen in human
history; that the persistence of vice within the sphere of Christianity
is the despair of its devotees; and that even in the matter of human
sacrifice the hideous massacre wrought on that pretext by the crusaders
at Jerusalem tells of a terrible <i>per contra</i> to the account of
the faith. To claim for Christianity the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e999" href="#xd21e999" name="xd21e999">xvi</a>]</span>latter-day
curtailment of slavery, finally, would be to ignore alike the potent
economic and the political causation, and to overlook the fact that the
strongest defence ever made of slavery as an institution was founded on
the Christian sacred books. These facts belong to the &ldquo;history of
Christianity,&rdquo; like the facts of missionary enterprise and the
establishment of universities by the Papacy in the Middle Ages: a mere
recital of all the forms of progress made in the Christian era has no
claim to such a title.</p>
<p class="par">Doubtless it is difficult to trace all the reactions of
creed upon society and polity; and it is not to be pretended that a
general sketch can even establish the main critical principles to be
applied, any more than it can complete the outline of the facts. But
inasmuch as the popular fashion of doing both is wholly fallacious, a
concise statement which aims at both is necessary, and may lead to
fuller and better elucidations. In the preface to the first edition, a
hope was expressed that such a conspectus might do an occasional
service even to an opponent by bringing out a clear issue; and one
hostile German critic was good enough to say that this service had been
done.</p>
<p class="par">If there has been more repudiation of the main historic
statement than the author expected, it may not unfairly be attributed
to the temper of dislike of all innovating judgment which has always
marked religious discussion. Spontaneous resentment operates in advance
of critical reflection; and blame is so much more simple than
refutation. Even men who have made concessions to one line of reasoned
objection are often slow to listen to another; and the practice of
&ldquo;the higher criticism&rdquo; leaves many at an uncritical
standpoint in regard to sociological problems. To readers who may be
under the sway of such prepossession, the author can but offer the
reminder that this history proceeds upon a definite view of historical
science. It is not an attempt to indicate <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1005" href="#xd21e1005" name="xd21e1005">xvii</a>]</span>all the
good or all the evil wrought by Christians, any more than a work of
&ldquo;natural history&rdquo; so-called is an attempt to summarize the
lives of myriads of plants or animals. It is an attempt, in terms of
the data, to establish principles of causation, to trace broadly the
reactions of a given creed on polity, conduct, and thought, and to
summarize the reactions of those on the formation and fortunes of the
creed itself. To the adherents of the creed it will naturally figure as
&ldquo;an attack&rdquo; insofar as it gives an unflattering or
subversive account of the historical process. It is none the less a
work of scientific investigation, written with the object, first and
last, of getting at the historic truth.</p>
<p class="par">This, it must be observed, is a different thing from the
purpose of what is called &ldquo;edification,&rdquo; so often acted on,
and even professed, by professional theologians. Recently, for
instance, the Dean of Durham preached a special sermon to miners, in
which he urged, not that the Christian religion is true and the
disregard of it fatal to future salvation, but that &ldquo;we are so
fashioned that a religion we must have.&rdquo; All the while, the
confessed motive for the declaration was that so many actually feel no
such need; and the &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do without it&rdquo; thus
approximated to the advertisement of a new typewriter. Men who assert
and claim to prove that the given religion is &ldquo;not true&rdquo;
were at the same time represented by Dr. Henson as merely urging their
fellows to &ldquo;give no thought to religion.&rdquo; Here we have not
merely a negative but a positive indifference to truth.</p>
<p class="par">Unfortunately such indifference&mdash;at least the
negative&mdash;is countenanced in the name of science by some
&ldquo;men of science&rdquo; whose qualifications, however high, are
gained in the physical and not in the &ldquo;human&rdquo; sciences, and
who apply to the latter critical standards of a laxity which they would
refuse to recognize in their own province. By such propagandists,
ultimate questions of historic truth are never <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1011" href="#xd21e1011" name=
"xd21e1011">xviii</a>]</span>subjected to scientific examination at
all, and tradition is at many points accepted more uncritically than by
many of the more scrupulous theological scholars. At the same time the
expediency of cultivating &ldquo;religious fervour&rdquo; is taken for
granted without any ostensible inquiry as to how religious fervour has
affected society in the past. In the following survey, the historical
and the sociological problems are alike sought to be treated as
scientific issues, calling for strictly scientific examination. The
only relevant answer, therefore, from the author&rsquo;s point of view,
will be one which shows either that the historical statement is false
or that the sociological inferences are fallacious.</p>
<p class="par">Yet another phase of the professional defence of the
faith calls for notice. At the close of a very comprehensive and
catholic survey of the religions of the world, Professor J. E.
Carpenter writes:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">There is no doubt whatever of the dependence of
Christianity upon Jewish Messianic expectation. Its pictures of human
destiny ... are pictures drawn by Jewish hands. Its promises of the
Advent of the Son of Man ... are couched in the language of earlier
Jewish books. For one religion builds upon another, and must use the
speech of its country and its time. Its forms must therefore change
from age to age.... But it will always embody man&rsquo;s highest
thought concerning the mysteries that surround him, and will express
his finest attitude to life. Its beliefs may be gradually modified; ...
but history shows it to be among the most permanent of social forces,
and the most effective agent for the slow elevation of the
race.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1018src" href="#xd21e1018" name=
"xd21e1018src">1</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">We have here two typical assumptions: first, that
religion <i>always</i> did, and always will, &ldquo;embody man&rsquo;s
highest thought&rdquo; and &ldquo;express his finest attitude to
life&rdquo;; second, that it is &ldquo;the most effective agent for the
slow elevation of the race.&rdquo; No pretence is made of proving the
latter proposition; it is taken <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1032" href="#xd21e1032" name="xd21e1032">ix</a>]</span>for
granted, like the other. And the writer has previously declared (p. 34)
that &ldquo;Theologies may be many, but religion is one&rdquo;: all
religions, therefore, are included in the closing panegyric. We are
thus presented with the profoundly pessimistic proposition that the
welfare of humanity has always depended mainly upon the acceptance of
illusory beliefs; for neither the writer nor anyone else pretends to
believe that the mass of credences in question are aught else. Yet he
brings them all within his generalization. Of the old Aztec religion he
writes (p. 57) that &ldquo;out of the fusion of nationalities in Mexico
rose a developed polytheism in which lofty religious sentiment seems
strangely blended with a hideous and sanguinary ritual.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It becomes necessary to challenge emphatically the moral
and sociological science which thus certificates as &ldquo;lofty&rdquo;
beliefs admittedly bound up with systematic atrocity of action, and
sees an elevating force in creeds directly productive of immeasurable
evil. The religion last referred to was destroying the Aztec State,
morally and economically, when both alike were destroyed by Christian
invaders. Lay moral sense, now as so often in the past, must correct
the sacerdotal; and a false sociological generalization must be
confronted with the historic facts.</p>
<p class="par">The chapters which follow challenge, by simple historic
representation, both the ethical and the sociological judgments under
notice. If the reader is disposed, in deference to
&ldquo;authority,&rdquo; to assent to either, let him turn to another
volume in the same series with that of Professor Carpenter, the
<i>History of Freedom of Thought</i>, by Professor Bury; and he will
see presented, from a strictly historical point of view, the negation
of the doctrine that religion has been &ldquo;the most effective agent
for the slow elevation of the race.&rdquo; The sociological verdict of
the specialist in history is presumably as weighty as that of the
specialist in religion on the question of the causation of progress.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1041" href="#xd21e1041" name=
"xd21e1041">xx</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But I am far from suggesting that the question is to be
settled by &ldquo;authority&rdquo; of any kind. The prime necessity is
detached, independent, self-consistent thinking upon a broad scrutiny
of the facts. If these pages in any degree promote that process, they
will have justified their production.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the ancient history of religions, as in the
ancient history of nations, the first account given of origins is
almost always a myth. A divine or worshipful founder is craved by the
primitive imagination no less for cults and institutions, tribes and
polities, than for the forms of life and the universe itself; and
history, like science, may roughly be said to begin only when that
craving for first causes has been discredited, or controlled, by the
later arising instinct of exact observation. Such a check or control
tends to be set up by the presence of intelligently hostile forces, as
in the case of the religion of Mohammed, whose teaching warred with and
was warred on by rival faiths from the first, and whose own written and
definite doctrine forbade his apotheosis. Some of the early Christian
sects, which went far towards setting up independent cults, had their
origins similarly defined by the pressure of criticism from the main
body. But even in some such cases, notably in that of the
Manich&aelig;an movement, the myth-making process has partly eluded
hostile scrutiny;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1071src" href="#xd21e1071"
name="xd21e1071src">1</a> and earlier growths incurred much less of
critical inquiry. Before the Christian system had taken organised
historic form, in virtue of having come into the heritage of literary
and political method embodied in the Greco-Roman civilization, it is
rarely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>possible to trust the record of any cult&rsquo;s
beginnings, even where it professes to derive from a non-supernatural
teacher; so ungoverned is the myth-making instinct in the absence of
persistent criticism. Buddha, Zoroaster, and Moses are only less
obviously mythical figures than Krishna, Herakles, and Osiris. Of the
Christian cult it can at best be said that it takes its rise on the
border-land between the historical and the unhistorical, since any
rational defence of it to-day admits that in the story of its origins
there is at least an element of sheer myth.</p>
<p class="par">The oldest documents of the cult are ostensibly the
Epistles of Paul; and concerning these there are initial perplexities,
some being more or less clearly spurious&mdash;that is, very different
from or much later in character than the rest&mdash;while all of the
others show signs of interpolation. Taken as they stand, however, they
reveal a remarkable ignorance of the greater part of the narratives in
the gospels, and of the whole body of the teachings there ascribed to
Jesus. In three respects only do the Pauline writings give any support
to the histories later accepted by the Christian Church. They
habitually speak of Jesus as crucified, and as having risen from the
dead; they contain one account of the institution of the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper, in agreement with the gospel account; and they make one mention
of &ldquo;the twelve.&rdquo; But the two latter allusions occur in
passages (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2011">1 Cor.
xi</a> and <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015">xv</a>)
which have plain marks of interpolation; and when they are withdrawn
the Pauline letters tell only of a cult, Jewish in origin, in which a
crucified Jesus&mdash;called the Messiah or Christos or Anointed
One&mdash;figures as a saving sacrifice, but counts for absolutely
nothing as a teacher or even as a wonder-worker. Yet he is a God or
Demigod who has risen from the dead. A eucharist or religious meal is
celebrated in his name, but no mention is made of any teaching uttered
by the founder. And nothing in the epistles enables us even to date
them independently of the gospel narratives, which they so strangely
fail to confirm. Thus the case stands with the New Testament very much
as with the Old. As the Book of Judges reveals a state of Hebrew life
quite incompatible with that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href=
"#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>described in the Pentateuch as having
preceded it, so do the epistles of Paul reveal a stage of Christist
propaganda incompatible with any such prior development as is set forth
in the gospel. And the reasonable conclusion in the two cases seems to
be the same: that the documents setting forth the prior developments
are, as they now stand, not only later in composition but substantially
fictitious, even where they do not tell of supernatural events. The
only tenable alternative is the hypothesis of two separate movements of
Christism, which ignored or discredited each other.</p>
<p class="par">What needs to be explained in both cases is the way in
which the later narratives came to be compiled. Within a hundred years
from the date commonly assigned to the Crucifixion, there are Gentile
traces of a Jesuist or Christist movement deriving from Jewry, and
possessing a gospel or memoir as well as some of the Pauline and other
epistles, both spurious and genuine; but the gospel then current is
seen to have contained some matter not preserved in the canonical four,
and to have lacked much that those contain. Of those traces the
earliest are found in one epistle of Clement called Bishop of Rome (fl.
about 100), which, whether genuine or not, is ancient, and in the older
form of the epistles ascribed to the Martyr Ignatius (d. about 115?) of
which the same may be said. About the middle of the second century the
writings of Justin Martyr tell of a Christist memoir, but show no
knowledge of the Pauline epistles. All alike tell of a spreading cult,
with a theology not yet coherently dogmatic, founding mainly on a
crucified Jesus, faith in whom ensures salvation.</p>
<p class="par">Like the letters of Paul, those ascribed to Clement and
Ignatius tell of schisms and bitter strifes in the churches: that is
the constant note of Christian history from first to last. As to rites,
we have but a bare mention of the eucharist and of baptism; the story
of the founder&rsquo;s parentage is still unknown to the makers of
documents, and his miracles are as unheard of as most of his teachings.
There is nothing in Clement, or in the older Ignatian epistles, or in
that ascribed to Polycarp (<i>circa</i> 150), or in that of Barnabas
(same period), to show <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4"
name="pb4">4</a>]</span>knowledge of the existing gospels of Luke or
John; a solitary parallel to Luke being rather a proof that the passage
echoed had been taken from some earlier document; and the gospel
actually cited as late as Justin is certainly not identical with either
Mark or Matthew. Even from Paul there is hardly any quotation; and
Clement, who mentions or is made to mention his epistles to the
Corinthians, pens a long passage in praise of love which has no
quotation from the apostle&rsquo;s famous chapter on that head, though
it would have seemed made for his purpose. In view of their lax way of
quoting the Old Testament we may infer that the early Fathers or
forgers had few manuscripts; and it is plain that they set no such
store by Christian documents as they did by the Jewish; but the fact
remains that they fail to vouch for much even of those Pauline epistles
which commonly rank as incontestable. At times, as in the Pauline use
of the word <i>ektroma</i> (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:8">1 Cor.
xv, 8</a>), which occurs in a similar phrase in one of the Ignatian
epistles, there is reason to suspect that the &ldquo;apostolic&rdquo;
writing has been interpolated in imitation of the
&ldquo;post-apostolic.&rdquo; In the latter the expression is
appropriate; in the former it is not.</p>
<p class="par">It does not indeed follow that documents or chapters not
quoted or utilized by the Fathers were in their day non-existent. The
letters of Paul, supposing them to be genuine, would in any case be
only gradually made common property. All the evidence goes to show that
the early Christians were for the most part drawn from the illiterate
classes; and the age of abundant manuscripts would begin only with the
age of educated converts. But what is inconceivable is that one so
placed as Paul should never once cite the teachings of the founder, if
such teachings were current in his day in any shape; and what is
extremely improbable is that one so placed as Clement, or one forging
or interpolating in his name, should possess Paul&rsquo;s First Epistle
to the Corinthians as it now stands, and yet should barely mention it
in a letter to the same church dealing with almost the same problems.
In the first case, we are almost forced to conclude that the gospel
narratives were non-existent for the writer or writers <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>of the
Pauline epistles up to the point of the two interpolations which allege
an accepted tradition; and, in the second, that the Pauline epistles
themselves are nowhere to be taken as certainly genuine.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1108src" href="#xd21e1108" name="xd21e1108src">2</a>
Such irremovable doubt is the Nemesis of the early Christian habits of
forgery and fiction.</p>
<p class="par">There emerges, however, the residual fact that Paul
ranked in the second century as a historical and natural personage, in
whose name it was worth while to forge. For Paul&rsquo;s period, again,
Jesus was possibly a historical personage, since he was not declared to
be supernaturally born, though credited with a supernatural
resurrection. Broadly speaking, the age of an early Christian document
is found to be in the ratio of its narrative bareness, its lack of
biographical myth, its want of relation to the existing gospels. As
between the shorter and the longer form of the Ignatian epistles, the
question of priority is at once settled by the frequent citations from
the gospels and from Paul in the latter, and the lack of them in the
former. But all the documents alike appear to point to a movement which
remotely took its rise among the Jews long before the destruction of
the temple of Jerusalem by Titus in the year 70, and subsisted in Jewry
long afterwards; and, as the Jewish environment lacked many of the
forces of change present in the Gentile, it is to the Jewish form of
the cult that we must first look if we would trace its growth.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">&sect; 2.</span> <i>The Earliest
Christian Sects</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The first properly historical as distinct from the
&ldquo;scriptural&rdquo; notices of the Church at Jerusalem tell of a
quasi-Christian sect there, known as Ebionites or <i>Ebionim</i>, a
Hebrew word which signified simply &ldquo;the poor.&rdquo; From the
point of view of the Gentile Christians of the end of the second
century they were heretics, seeing that they used a form of the Gospel
of Matthew lacking the first two chapters, denied the divinity of
Jesus, and rejected the apostleship of Paul. As <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>they
likewise rejected the Hebrew prophets, accepting only the Pentateuch,
there is some reason to suppose that they were either of Samaritan
derivation or the descendants of an old element in the Judean
population which, from the time of Ezra onwards, had rejected the later
Biblical writings as the Samaritans did. On either view it would follow
that the Jesuist movement rooted from the first in a lower stratum of
the population, hostile to orthodox or Pharisaic Judaism, as were the
Sadducees among the upper classes. The Samaritans made special account
of Joshua (=Jesus), having a book which bore his name; and we shall see
later that that name was anciently a divine one for some Syrian
populations.</p>
<p class="par">Later notices bring to light the existence of a smaller
sect, called by the Greeks <i>Nazoraioi</i>, Nazarites or
Nazar&aelig;ans, the term said in the Acts of the Apostles (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=act%2024:5">xxiv, 5</a>)
to have been applied to the early Jesuists, and often applied in that
book as well as in the gospels to Jesus. According to one account this
sect objected to be called Christians, though it appears to have been
on the assumption of their derivation from the first Christians that
they had not earlier been stamped as heretics. Through the two sects
under notice may be gathered the probable development of early
Jesuism.</p>
<p class="par">It cannot have been from the place-name Nazareth that
any Jesuist sect were first called Nazar&aelig;ans, a term standing
either for the variously-spelt <i>Nazir</i> (Nazarite, or, properly,
Nazirite) of the Old Testament, or for a compound of the term
<i>netzer</i> (=a branch), used in the passage of Isaiah (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2011:1">xi, 1</a>),
supposed to be cited in the first gospel (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%202:23">ii, 23</a>).
Even the form &ldquo;Nazarene,&rdquo; sometimes substituted in the
gospels for the other, could not conceivably have been, to start with,
the name for a sect founded by a man who, like the gospel Jesus, was
merely said to have been reared at a village called Nazareth or Nazara,
and never taught there. In none of the Pauline or other canonical
epistles, however, is Jesus ever called Nazarite, or Nazarene, or
&ldquo;of Nazareth&rdquo;; and the Ebionite gospel, lacking the
Nazareth story, would lack any such appellation. The Ebionite sect,
then, appears to have stood for the first form of the cult, and to have
developed the first form of gospel; while <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>the later Nazar&aelig;an sect
appears to be either a post-Pauline but Judaic growth from the Ebionite
roots, or a post-Pauline grafting of another movement on the Jesuism of
the Ebionites.</p>
<p class="par">Ebionism, to begin with, whether ancient and
quasi-Samaritan or a product of innovation in the immediately pre-Roman
period, is intelligible as the label of a movement which held by the
saying &ldquo;Blessed are ye poor&rdquo; or &ldquo;poor in
spirit,&rdquo; found in the so-called Sermon on the Plain and Sermon on
the Mount (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%206:20">Luke vi,
20</a>; <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%205:3">Matt. v,
3</a>). In poverty-stricken Jewry, with a prophetic and proverbial
literature in which, as generally in the East, the poor are treated
with sympathy, such a label would readily grow popular, as it had done
for the Buddhist &ldquo;mendicants&rdquo; in India. Its association,
however, with the cult of a slain and Messianic Jesus raises the
question whether the latter was not the germ of the movement; and there
are some grounds for surmising that the sect may have arisen around one
Jesus the son of Pandira, who is mentioned in the Talmud as having been
hanged on a tree and stoned to death at Lydda, on the eve of a
Passover, in the reign of Alexander Jann&aelig;us. It was customary to
execute important offenders at that season; and as the Paschal feast
had a specifically atoning significance, a teacher then executed might
come to be regarded as an atoning sacrifice. But there are traces in
the Old Testament of a Messianic movement connected with the name Jesus
at some uncertain period before the Christian era. In the book of
Zechariah, of which the first six chapters appear to be much later than
the rest, there is named one Jesus (<i>Heb.</i> Joshua), a high priest,
who figures Messianically as &ldquo;the Branch,&rdquo; and is doubly
crowned as priest and king. In the obscurity which covers most of the
prophetic literature, it is difficult to say for what historic
activities this piece of symbolism stands; but it must have stood for
something. From it, in any case, we gather the fact that much stress
was laid on the symbol of &ldquo;the Branch&rdquo; (or
&ldquo;sprout&rdquo;), called in the present text of Zechariah
<i>tsemach</i>, but in Isaiah <i>nazar</i> or <i>netzer</i>. Among the
Gentiles that symbol belonged to the worships of several Gods and
Goddesses&mdash;as Mithra, Attis, Apollo, and
D&ecirc;m&ecirc;t&ecirc;r&mdash;and appears to have meant the principle
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>of life, typified in vegetation; among the Jews it
was certainly bound up with the general belief in a coming Messiah who
should restore Jewish independence. It is not impossible, then, that a
Messianic party were early called &ldquo;Netzerites&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Nazar&aelig;ans&rdquo; on that account; and such a sect could in
the Judaic fashion find all manner of significances in the name of the
high priest, since &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; (=Joshua) signified Saviour, and
the ancient and mythical Joshua was a typical deliverer. The Mosaic
promise (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2018:15">Deut. xviii,
15</a>) of a later prophet and leader, which in the Acts is held to
apply to the crucified Jesus, had formerly been held by Jews to apply
to the Joshua who succeeded Moses; and in that case there is reason to
surmise that an older myth or cult centring round the name had given
rise to the historical fiction of the Hebrew books. In some very
ancient MSS. the text of the epistle of Jude, verse 5, reads
&ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; where our version has &ldquo;the Lord,&rdquo; a
circumstance which suggests yet another Joshuan myth. But the subject
remains obscure. There is even some doubtful evidence of the later
existence of a sect of &ldquo;Jesseans,&rdquo; possibly distinct from
the historical &ldquo;Essenes,&rdquo; who may have founded on
Isaiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;Branch from the roots of Jesse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The following, then, are the historical possibilities. A
poor sect or caste of <i>Ebionim</i>, marked off from orthodox Jewry,
and akin to the population of Samaria, may have subsisted throughout
the post-exilic period, and may either have preserved an old Jesuist
cult with a sacrament or adopted a later Samaritan movement. From that
might have been developed the &ldquo;Nazarene&rdquo; sect of Christist
history. On the other hand, a sect of &ldquo;Nazar&aelig;ans,&rdquo;
holding by the Messianic name of Jesus, <i>may</i> have existed in the
pre-Roman period, but may have come to figure specially as Ebionim or
&ldquo;poor&rdquo; when the earlier or political form of Messianic hope
waned. Their name may also have led to their being either confused or
conjoined with the &ldquo;Nazarites&rdquo; of Jewry, a numerous but
fluctuating body, under temporary vows of abstention. But that body,
again, may have become generally Messianist, and may have adopted the
Messianic &ldquo;Branch&rdquo; in the verbalizing spirit so common in
Jewry, while continuing to call itself <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>Nazarite in the old sense. It
is indeed on record that some Jews made vows to &ldquo;be a Nazarite
when the Son of David should come&rdquo;; and such were free to drink
wine on Sabbaths, though not on week days. Such Nazarites could have
constituted the first sacramental assemblies of the Christists. And as
the Hebrew <i>Nazir</i> (Sept. Gr. <i>Nazoraios</i>) had the meaning of
&ldquo;consecrated&rdquo; or &ldquo;holy to the Lord,&rdquo; the early
Gentile Christians may very well have translated the word into their
own languages instead of transliterating it. On that view the
<i>hagioi</i> or &ldquo;saints&rdquo; of the Acts and the epistles and
the Apocalypse may have strictly stood for &ldquo;the Nazirites,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the <i>devoti</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Seeing, however, that the later Nazar&aelig;ans are
reported to have adopted the (obviously late) first and second chapters
of Matthew, while the Ebionites rejected them; and seeing that these
chapters, embodying the story of the flight into Egypt, make Jesus at
once a Jewish and a Gentile Christ, it would appear that the Gentile
movement had then reacted on the Jewish, and that the ultra-Jewish
Jesuists had now relinquished the name of Nazar&aelig;an to the less
rigid, who at this stage probably used a Greek gospel. Finally, as the
original sense of &ldquo;Nazirite&rdquo; implied either a Judaic
vow&mdash;irksome to the Gentile Christians, and probably to many of
the Jewish&mdash;or a specially Judaic character in the founder, and as
the political implication of the &ldquo;netzer&rdquo; (supposing that
to have adhered to the sect-name) was anti-Roman, there would arise a
disposition to seek for the term another significance. This, presumably
on the suggestion of Gentiles accustomed to hear Jewish sectaries
called &ldquo;Galileans,&rdquo; was found in the figment that the
founder, though declared to have been Messianically born in Bethlehem,
had been reared in the Galilean village of Nazareth or Nazara. Instead
of being a historical datum, as is assumed by so many rationalizing
historians, that record appears to be really a pragmatic myth
superimposed on the Bethlehem myth. The textual analysis shows that
wherever it occurs in the gospels and Acts the name Nazareth has been
foisted on the documents.</p>
<p class="par">Hence, however, arose the Greek form
&ldquo;Nazarenos,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=
"#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>which finally became to a certain
extent imposed on the canonical gospels, but especially on that of
Mark, which appears to have been redacted under Roman authority in the
interests of ecclesiastical order. Naturally, the Latin Vulgate adopted
the same term throughout the gospels and Acts, save in the crucial
text, <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%202:23">Matt. ii,

&ldquo;Nazoraios&rdquo;&mdash;that is, Nazar&aelig;an or Nazirite.</p>

of the Nominal Founder</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Even for minds wont to see mere myth in the idea
of such long-worshipped Saviours as Apollo and Osiris, Krishna and
Mithra, it cannot but be startling to meet for the first time the
thought that there is no historic reality in a figure so long revered
and beloved by half the human race as the Jesus of the gospels. It was
only after generations of scrutiny that modern rationalism began to
doubt the actuality of the Teacher it had unhesitatingly surmised
behind the impossible demigod of the records. The first, indeed, to see
in him sheer myth were the students who were intent chiefly on the
myths of action in the story: to return to the teaching as such was to
recover the old impression of a real voice. It is only after a further
analysis&mdash;a scrupulous survey of the texts&mdash;that the inquirer
can realise how illusory that impression really is.</p>
<p class="par">The proposition is not that the mere lateness of the
gospels deprives them of authority as evidence (for they proceeded on
earlier documents), but that throughout they are demonstrably results
of accretion through several generations, and that the earliest
sections were put together long after the period they profess to deal
with. The older portions of the Pauline epistles show no knowledge of
any Jesuine biography or any Jesuine teaching&mdash;a circumstance
which suggests that the Jesus of Paul is much more remote from
Paul&rsquo;s day than is admitted by the records. Later, the Christian
writers are found to have certain narratives, evidently expanded from
generation to generation, till at the end of the second century there
exist the four canonical gospels, which, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>however, are not known to
have been even then completed. Celsus, in his anti-Christian treatise,
supposed to have been written between 170 and 180, speaks of the
gospels as having undergone endless alteration; and additions were
still possible after the time of Origen, who weakly replied to Celsus
that the alterations were the work of heretics. Side by side with the
four there had grown up a number of &ldquo;apocryphal&rdquo; gospels,
of which some were long as popular as the canonical, though all were
ultimately discarded by the Councils of the Church. The principle of
exclusion was essentially that of the tentative criticism of modern
times&mdash;the critical sense of the inferiority of mere tales of
wonders to narratives which contained, besides wonders, elements of
moral instruction.</p>
<p class="par">In natural course criticism first rejects miraculous
episodes, next excludes teachings which purport to come from a God-man,
and then seeks to infer a personality from those which are left; but
inasmuch as those, like the rest, are disparate and even contradictory,
the process usually ends in an avowedly arbitrary selection. And to all
such selection the loyal study of the texts is fatal. To put aside, as
some still do, the fourth gospel, and then take a stand on the
synoptics, is merely to arrest factitiously the critical process,
which, when consistently pursued, leads to the conviction that the
synoptics were built up by the same order of impulses, under the same
conditions of unchecked invention and interpolation, as gave rise to
the most obvious fictions in the gospel of &ldquo;John.&rdquo; We are
led without escape to the conclusion that no strain of teaching in the
gospels can be fathered on the shadowy founder, who for Paul is only a
crucified phantom. The humanistic teachings are no more primordial, no
less capable of interpolation, than the mystical and the oracular. Some
of the best sayings are among the very latest; some of the narrowest
belong to the earliest tradition. Collectively, they tell of a hundred
hands.</p>
<p class="par">Surmising that the nominal founder of Paul&rsquo;s
Jesuism may possibly be the slain Jesus Pandira of the Talmud, a
hundred years &ldquo;before Christ,&rdquo; we next ask whether any such
founder must not be supposed to have taught <i>something</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>to make men see in him a Messiah and preserve his
name. The answer is that the name alone was a large part of the
qualification for a Jewish Messiah; that the chance of his execution on
the eve of the Passover would give it for some Jews a mystic
significance; and that a story of his resurrection, a story easily
floated in case of an alleged sorcerer, such as the Talmudic Jesus,
would complete the conditions required for the growth of a myth and a
cult, seeing that the Jews traditionally expected the Messiah to come
at midnight of the day of Passover. Doubtless the alleged sorcerer may
have been an innovating teacher. It is quite possible, indeed, that as
a bearer of the fated name he may have made Messianic claims: the form
of death said to have been inflicted on him suggests energetic priestly
or political hostility. But of his utterances history preserves no
trace: even in the Talmud his story has passed into legendary form.
Thus it is not even certain that &ldquo;pre-Christian&rdquo; Jesuism
took shape round the memory of an actual man. The mythic Joshua (Jesus)
of the Old Testament is seen to have been in all likelihood, like
Samson, an ancient Semitic Sun-God, his name, &ldquo;the
Saviour,&rdquo; being a common divine epithet; and as he is in
Perso-Arab tradition the son of the mythic Miriam (Mary), it may be
that the roots of the historic Christian cult go back to an immemorial
Semitic antiquity, when already the name of Jesus was divine.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1237src" href="#xd21e1237" name="xd21e1237src">3</a>
In the shadow of that name its origins are hidden.</p>
<p class="par">What is clear is that the central narrative of the
gospel biography, the story of the Last Supper, the Agony, Betrayal,
Trial, and Crucifixion, is neither a contemporary report nor a
historical tradition, but the simple transcript of a Mystery-Drama. The
proof lies in the very structure of the document.</p>
<p class="par">Anyone who will attentively follow the account of the
Last Supper and its sequel&aelig; in the first gospel will see that it
reproduces a series of closely-continuous dramatic scenes, with no room
given to such considerations as would naturally occur to a narrator of
real events, and no sign of perception <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>of the extreme
improbability of the huddled sequence set forth. A more or less
unnatural compression of events is the specific mark of drama, even in
the hands of great masters, as Shakespeare and Ibsen; and the primitive
mystery-play, as might be expected, is excessively compressed, so as to
conform to the recognised Greek rule that the action of a drama should
be limited to twenty-four hours. Jesus is made to take the Passover
after dark; then to go forth in the night for no reason given with his
disciples, who sleep while he prays; then to be captured in the
darkness by a &ldquo;multitude&rdquo;; then to be taken straight to the
high priest, &ldquo;where the scribes and elders were gathered
together.&rdquo; These now proceed, in the dead of the night, to
&ldquo;seek false witnesses,&rdquo; and &ldquo;many false
witnesses&rdquo; come, to no purpose, till &ldquo;afterward&rdquo; come
two who testify to his words about destroying the temple; whereupon he
is judged and buffeted, and the night&rsquo;s history ends with the
episode of Peter&rsquo;s denial. No hint is ever given of anything said
or done or felt by Jesus on the way from the Supper to the Mount, or in
the interval between the Jewish and the Roman trials.</p>
<p class="par">Such a narrative cannot have been originally composed
for reading. A writer, whether inventing or reproducing hearsay, would
have sought to explain the strangely protracted midnight procedure of
the high priest and scribes and elders; would have given some thought
to the time necessary between event and event; would have thought of
the Lord in his dungeon. The story before us yields exactly what could
be scenically enacted, nothing more; and where on the stage the
successive scenes would originally raise no question of the time taken,
the unreflecting narrative loses all verisimilitude by making
everything happen in unbroken sequence, and by making the Master utter
words of prayer which, apart from the audience of the drama, there was
no one to hear. In the play the &ldquo;false witnesses&rdquo; would of
necessity be sent for and introduced without lapse of time, and the
action would raise in a popular audience no perplexity, where the
narrative loses all semblance of probability by turning the dramatic
act into a historical process. After the unspecified slight pause till
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>&ldquo;the morning was come,&rdquo; the action is
resumed before Pilate with the same dramatic speed, and the execution
impossibly follows immediately on the trial. We are reading the bare
transcript of a mystery-drama; a transcript so bare that, in the scene
of the Passion, the speech beginning &ldquo;Sleep on now,&rdquo; and
that beginning &ldquo;Arise, let us be going,&rdquo; are put together
as if they were one utterance, without specification of the required
exit and entrance between.</p>
<p class="par">Such a clearly dramatic composition can be accounted for
only as a development, after the fashion of the pagan mystery-dramas,
from a remote, primitive rite of human sacrifice, such as we know to
have been long habitual among the Jews as among other Semites. To the
ancient rite the very name of Jesus probably belonged; and the existing
document is presumptively an adaptation, made after the fall of
Jerusalem by Gentile Christists, of a simpler and earlier Judaic
ritual-drama. We are thus left facing a myth, not a history&mdash;a
Jesus who compares not with Mohammed but with Dionysos and Osiris.</p>
<p class="par">When the historic Church set about a statement of its
history it could not even fix satisfactorily the year of its supposed
founder&rsquo;s birth; and the &ldquo;Christian era&rdquo; was made to
begin some years&mdash;two, three, four, five, or eight&mdash;after
that on which the chronologists were later fain to fix, by way of
conforming to their most precise document. Their data, however, have no
more value than any other guess. So little of the semblance of
historical testimony do the gospels yield that it is impossible to
establish from them any proposition as to the duration of the
God-man&rsquo;s ministry; and the early Church in general held by the
tradition that it lasted exactly one year, an opinion which again
points straight to myth, since it is either a dogmatic assumption based
on the formula of &ldquo;the acceptable year of the Lord,&rdquo; or a
simple reversion to the story of the Sun-God. Of the life of the
alleged teacher from the age of twelve to thirty&mdash;another
mythological period&mdash;there is not a single trace, mythical or
non-mythical, though at his death he is represented as the centre of a
large and adoring following. Ultimately, his birth was placed at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>winter solstice, the birth-day of the Sun-God in
the most popular cults; and while that is fixed as an anniversary, the
date of his crucifixion is made to vary from year to year in order to
conform to the astronomical principle on which the Jews, following the
sun-worshippers, had fixed their Passover. Between those fabulous
points everything the gospels affirm as biographical fact is fortuitous
or purposive invention, which on scientific analysis &ldquo;leaves not
a wrack behind&rdquo; in the nature of objective history.</p>
<p class="par">Before accepting such a verdict the sympathetic seeker
is apt to grasp at the old argument that such a figure as the gospel
Jesus cannot have been created either by fortuitous fable or by
fictions; that its moral stature is above that of any of the men we can
trace in the gospel-making period; that its spiritual unity excludes
the theory of a literary mosaic. It must first be answered that these
positions beg the question and falsify the data. That the figure of the
gospel Jesus is actually devoid of moral unity is made clear by the
very attempts to unify it, since they one and all leave out much of the
records; and the claim to moral superiority collapses, even apart from
the obvious fact that the texts are aggregations, as soon as we compare
them with the contemporary and previous ethical literature of the Jews,
Greeks, Romans, and Hindus. There is not one teaching in the gospels
that is not there paralleled; and the passages which have been claimed
as most characteristic&mdash;for instance, the Sermon on the
Mount&mdash;are mere compilations of earlier Jewish utterances. Thus
the unity credited to the records, and the personality ascribed to the
founder, are but creations of the same sympathetic human imagination
that wove tissues of poetry and pathos round the figures of Dionysos
and Buddha, and framed for the cult of Krishna its most impressive
document when the cult was already ancient beyond reckoning. As man has
made his Gods, so he has made his Christs: it would be strange indeed
if the faculty which wrought the one could not create the other.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">&sect; 4.</span> <i>Myth of the
Twelve Apostles</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In one of the Pauline epistles, which are usually
understood to belong to the second generation after that of the
founder, there is mention of three chief Apostles with whom Paul had
disputes, but none of any contemporary group of Twelve; and the only
historical allusion to the latter number is in one of the
interpolations in First Corinthians, where it appears to be a patch
upon a patch. In the Acts of the Apostles, which though a fraudulent is
an ancient compilation, there is a preliminary story of the election of
an apostle to fill the place of Judas, deceased and disgraced; but not
only is there no further pretence of such a process of completion, the
majority of the twelve themselves speedily disappear from the history.
Once more we are dealing with a myth. In the Apocalypse, again, after
the original Judaic document has pictured a New Jerusalem with twelve
gates and angels, named after the twelve tribes, the Christian
interpolator has betrayed himself by the awkward invention of twelve
&ldquo;basement courses&rdquo; named after the &ldquo;twelve Apostles
of the Lamb,&rdquo; where an original Christian author would have given
the apostles the gates if anything, had a list of twelve Jesuist
apostles existed for him. In heaven the Lamb is surrounded, not by
twelve disciples, but by the &ldquo;four and twenty presbyters&rdquo;
of an older cult, probably that of Babylonia, which had twenty-four
&ldquo;Counsellor Gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In the gospels the lack of historic foundation is no
less decisive. Circumstantial but irreconcilable accounts, obviously
mythical, are given of the selection of four or five apostles,
whereafter the narratives, without a word of preparation or
explanation, proceed to a sudden constitution of the group of twelve,
with only the mythological detail, in one case, that they were
&ldquo;called&rdquo; by the Master on a mountain. Thus the element of
the Twelve is not even an early item in the records. It has been
imposed on documents which set out with no such datum, but with primary
groups of five, four, and three.</p>
<p class="par">The historical solution of the problem as to the source
of the fiction is now tolerably certain. It is on record that the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>Jewish High Priest of the latter days of the
Temple, and after him the Patriarch at Tiberias, employed certain
&ldquo;Apostles&rdquo; as tribute-collectors and supervisors of the
many faithful Jews scattered throughout the neighbouring kingdoms. By
common Jewish usage these would number twelve. As the dispersed Jewish
race multiplied abroad after the fall of the Temple, it is probable
that under the upper grade of twelve there was created a body of
seventy-two collectors, who answered to the traditional number of
&ldquo;the nations&rdquo; in Jewish lore. Such a body is the probable
basis for the admittedly mythical &ldquo;seventy&rdquo; or
&ldquo;seventy-two&rdquo; of the third gospel. At this stage the twelve
appear to have exercised chiefly teaching and regulative functions, for
it is clear that the quasi-Christian document, <i>The Teaching of the
Twelve Apostles</i>, recovered in 1873 and published in 1883, was
originally a purely Jewish manual of moral exhortation, and as such
bore its existing title. To the six or seven purely Judaic and
non-Jesuist chapters which seem to constitute the original document,
and which contain passages copied in the so-called Sermon on the Mount,
there were gradually added others, introducing the rites of baptism and
the eucharist, the name of Jesus, the doctrine of the Trinity, and
various rules of economic procedure. In this gradual fashion a Jesuist
cult, in which Jesus is called the &ldquo;servant&rdquo; of God, was
grafted on an originally Judaic moral teaching, the prestige of the
Jewish &ldquo;Twelve Apostles&rdquo; being all the while carried on. It
was to give a Christian origin for this document, or for the
institution pointed to by its title, that the gospel myth of the Twelve
Apostles was framed. After the time of Athanasius, the expanded
document, being still unduly Judaic and otherwise unsuitable for the
purposes of the organized Church, passed into disuse; but the myth
remained.</p>
<p class="par">As regards the three &ldquo;chief&rdquo; apostles named
in one of the Pauline epistles, there is a reasonable presumption that
they were either leading propagandists of the Jesuist cult as it
existed at the time of the writing, or so reputed by later tradition;
but the assumption that they had been associates and disciples of the
founder must be abandoned with the rest of the gospel <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>tradition. They were necessarily woven into the
gospel narrative by the later compilers; but the Epistle to the
Galatians lies under the general suspicion of having been interpolated,
if not wholly forged; and its very naming of the Judaic apostles is as
much a ground for question as a datum for construction. It is probable,
further, that the title &ldquo;brethren of the Lord&rdquo; was
originally a group-name, and that the literal construction of it was a
misconception by the later readers or interpolators of the epistles and
the gospels. Nothing in the gospels or the Acts can make intelligible
the appearance of certain actual brothers of the gospel Jesus at the
head of a Jesuist cult. The name of Peter, finally, became a nucleus
for many myths; and the two epistles which bear his name have so little
relation to the personality set forth in the gospels that both have
been widely discredited as forgeries; the second having indeed been so
reputed in the days of Eusebius. The Simon-Petros (Cephas) of the
gospels, however, is in himself a mere literary creation. Represented
there as basely denying his captured Master, he figures in the Acts as
the supernatural slayer of Ananias and Sapphira for a much slighter
sin. The gospel story must be one of the products of the anti-Judaic
animus of later Gentile Jesuists, for even the Ananias story is late.
All that holds good is the fact that a tradition grew round the names
in question, both of which hint of mythology&mdash;Petros (&ldquo;the
Rock&rdquo;) being the name of an Egyptian God and of the popular
Eastern deity Mithra; and Simon the name of a no less popular Semitic
God. In his final aspect as leader of the twelve, basis of the Church,
and keeper of the heavenly keys, Peter combines the attributes of
Mithra and of Janus, both official deities of the Roman military class,
as well as of the Egyptian Petra&mdash;who is door-keeper of heaven,
earth, and the underworld.</p>
<p class="par">The Epistle of James, by whomsoever written, is in no
sense a Christist document&mdash;containing as it does not a single
Jesuist or Christian doctrine, save perhaps the appended invective
against the rich, which is Ebionitic. Of its two namings of Jesus, one
is clearly an interpolation, and the other is presumptively so. There
remains only a moral exhortation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19"
href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>to Jews meeting in synagogues, a
teaching strictly comparable to that of the original and pre-Jesuine
&ldquo;Teaching of the Twelve Apostles,&rdquo; though the epistle makes
no mention of any other apostles. Such writing tells of an essentially
different propaganda from that of the Christists proper; and its
preservation by them testifies to its priority. The epistles ascribed
to John, on the contrary, belong to a considerably later period;
telling as they do of a fanatical movement which swears by the name of
Jesus the Christ as one who has died to take away sin, but which is
full of apprehension as to the advent and functions of a number of
Anti-Christs.</p>
<p class="par">Judas (Ioudas), of whom there is no mention in any of
the epistles, and whose traditional treason is not recognized in the
lately-recovered &ldquo;Gospel of Peter,&rdquo; or in the
pseudo-Pauline reference to &ldquo;the twelve,&rdquo; is a late
creation; having probably taken shape first as a simple
<i>Ioudaios</i>, &ldquo;a Jew,&rdquo; in an early Christian
mystery-play of the crucifixion and resurrection. Mythologically, the
conception may derive from the <i>Diabolos</i> or
&ldquo;Adversary&rdquo; of Persian lore, as Judas in the gospels is
called &ldquo;a devil&rdquo;; and the tradition which gave him red hair
assimilated him to Typhon, the slayer of the Egyptian Saviour-God,
Osiris. On the other hand, the name may have a mythological connection
with the story of the betrayal of Joseph by his eleven brethren, of
whom Judas was the ringleader.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1297src"
href="#xd21e1297" name="xd21e1297src">4</a> The story of the betrayal
in the gospels is in any case plainly fabulous. The hired help of Judas
is represented as necessary to identify a teacher who figured daily in
the temple, and was a familiar figure to the populace. Such a myth can
be best explained on the theory that a Jesuist mystery-play, arising or
becoming modified among the Gentiles, would readily represent a Jew as
betraying the Lord, even as the twelve were represented as forsaking
their master. A bag to hold the blood-money would be a dramatic
accessory, and would originate the view that Judas had been the
treasurer of the apostolic group. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20"

of the Cult</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In its first traceable historic form Christianity
was simply a phase of Judaism, being the creed of a small number of
Jews and Jewish proselytes who believed that the long-desired Messiah
had come in the person of one Jesus, who had been so slain as to
constitute an atoning sacrifice. Such believers were wont to meet at
simple religious banquets, of a kind common in the Greco-Roman world,
where they ate and drank in a semi-ceremonial way. A sacrificial
banquet of this kind was one of the most universal features of ancient
religion, being originally the typical tribal ceremony; and though
among the Jews it had been to a remarkable extent superseded by
sacrifices without communion, the usage was once as general with them
as with the Gentiles. If grown rare in their life, the idea was
abundantly preserved in their sacred books. The presumption is that
such a banquet was connected with the Semitic God-name Jesus or Joshua
before the Christian era; otherwise we must conclude that a sect of
Jesuists, starting from the bare belief in the sacrificial death,
adopted arbitrarily a kind of rite which was identified with the
heathen worships of the surrounding Gentiles, and adopted also the
Gentile sun-worshippers&rsquo; practice of assembling by night.
Paul&rsquo;s Corinthian converts are described as frequenting
indifferently the table of Jesus (&ldquo;the Lord&rdquo;) and the table
of &ldquo;d&aelig;mons&rdquo;&mdash;that is, of heathen Gods or
Demigods. As the less orthodox Jews had long<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1320src" href="#xd21e1320" name="xd21e1320src">5</a> dabbled in
similar &ldquo;mysteries,&rdquo; there is every probability that
private &ldquo;Holy Suppers&rdquo; had been practised even in Jewry by
some groups long before the Christian period, whether or not in
connection with the name of Jesus &ldquo;the Saviour.&rdquo; The gospel
phrase &ldquo;blood of the covenant&rdquo; points to a standing usage,
the original form of which was probably the mutual drinking of actual
human blood by the parties to a solemn pledge. In the Hebrew system
some such covenant was held to be set up between the Deity and the
worshippers on the one hand, and among the latter themselves on the
other, when a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>sacrifice was partaken of. But it is further
probable that the idea of a mystical partaking of an atoning or
inspiring &ldquo;body and blood&rdquo; was of old standing in the same
kind of connection. Such a practice was certainly part of the great
Asiatic cults of Dionysos and Mithra; and as the ancient idea of a
sacrificial banquet in honour of a God usually was that in some sense
the worshipped power was either eaten, or present as partaker, it is
more than likely that any banquets in connection with the Syrian
worships of Adonis and (or) Marnas (each name = &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo;)
carried with them the same significance. In early Christian usage the
ministrant of the eucharist spoke in the person of the founder, using
the formulas preserved in the gospels; and as the priest in the cult of
Attis also personated the God, there is a strong presumption that the
same thing had been done in Jewry in the pre-Christian period, by way
of modifying a still older usage in which a deified victim was actually
slain and eaten.</p>
<p class="par">For such an ancient Jesuine eucharist (revived, perhaps,
as old mysteries were apt to be among the Jews, no less than among
other ancient peoples, in times of national disaster) a new meaning
<i>may</i> have been found in the story of an actually slain man Jesus,
whose death took a sacrificial aspect from its occurrence at the time
of the atoning feast. In the earliest written teaching, certainly,
Jesus is not a God; he is merely the Jewish God&rsquo;s &ldquo;holy
servant.&rdquo; The eating of his symbolic body and blood, however, was
on a par with the rituals in which Pagans mystically partook of
<i>their</i> deities, and it thus lay in the nature of the eucharist
that he should become divine if he were not so originally. The
expression &ldquo;Son of God,&rdquo; once of common application, would
in his case come to have a special force, in terms of the ancient
Semitic doctrine that the great God Kronos or Saturn or El had
sacrificed his &ldquo;only begotten Son.&rdquo; Abraham undertakes to
do the same thing in the legend in Genesis; and Abraham and Isaac as
well as Jacob were presumptively ancient deities. On the other hand,
the evolution of a fabulous hero from man to demigod, and thence to a
status among the highest Gods, is a common phenomenon in the ancient
religions (Herakles and Dionysos <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"
href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>being typical cases), and among
the recognized Syrian worships there was already one of a
<i>Theandrios</i> or God-man. Even for the Jews the name Jehovah was
applicable to the Messiah. It lay, too, in the nature of the religious
instinct that the man-like and man-loving God should gradually take the
foremost place in a cult in which he was at first subordinate, as
happened in the worships of Dionysos, Mithra, Herakles, and Krishna.
Some such tendency is seen in the worship of Demigods among the earlier
Hebrews (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2032:17">Deut. xxxii,
17</a>; <i>Heb.</i>).</p>
<p class="par">It is not necessary to suppose that the Christian cult
arose solely by way of a mystic sacrament. There may have been a
blending of the usage of quasi-commemorative banquets, the simpler
<i>Agap&aelig;</i> or love-feasts of antiquity, with that of a special
&ldquo;mystery&rdquo;; and in the case of the latter there may have
been many varieties, as there were later in the matter of liturgies.
The humble Corinthian banquets appear to have combined the features of
<i>Agap&aelig;</i> and <i>Eucharistia</i>, and in the former aspect
they were anything but solemn; some of the members sleeping, some
drinking too much&mdash;a pathetic picture of the dim yearning for
communion among a heavy-laden caste. But the nature of the eucharist
proper, the claim to present an immortal &ldquo;body and blood&rdquo;
for regenerative eating and drinking, involved a striving after
sacro-sanctity; and as soon as a regular ministrant was appointed by
any group he would tend to develop into a priest of the Christist
mysteries, magnifying his office.</p>
<p class="par">The great feature of the Jewish Feast of the Passover
being the eating of a lamb &ldquo;before the Lord,&rdquo; that usage
would in Jewish circles be preferred to, or at least combined with, the
sacrament of bread and wine, &ldquo;Ceres and Bacchus,&rdquo; which was
perhaps commonest among the Gentiles. In the legend of Abraham and
Melchisedek, priest of the Ph&oelig;nician God El Elyon, there figures
a sacramental meal of bread and wine (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2014:18">Gen. xiv,
18</a>); and in the non-canonical book of Ecclesiasticus there is a
passage (l, 15) which suggests a use of wine as symbolical of blood.
The &ldquo;shew-bread,&rdquo; too, seems to have had a measure of
sacramental significance. But while such a rite would seem to have
flourished in the background of Judaism, that of the Passover was one
of the great usages of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span>the Jewish world, and the first Jesuists
clearly held by it. It is indeed one of the hierological probabilities
that the paschal lamb was anciently &ldquo;Jeschu&rdquo; or Jesus, the
springtide symbol of a Sun-God so named; for in the book of Revelation,
which is markedly Judaic, &ldquo;the Lamb&rdquo; figures as the known
symbol or mystic name of a Son of God &ldquo;slain from the founding of
the world,&rdquo; and identified with a mystic Jesus who is one with
Jehovah&mdash;this apparently long before the Christian cult in general
had arrived at such a doctrine. There is a mythological presumption
that such language had reference to the fact&mdash;dwelt on by later
Jewish writers&mdash;that the date of the Passover fell at the entrance
of the sun into the constellation Aries in the zodiac; and the rule
that the paschal lamb must be roasted, not boiled, tells also of the
sun-myth. Yet again, the lamb is the animal latterly substituted in the
myth of Abraham and Isaac for the sacrificed only-begotten son Isaac,
whose name in the Hebrew (Yischak) comes somewhat near to the common
form of the name Jesus (Yeschu), and who is mythologically identifiable
as a Sun-God. In any case, &ldquo;the Lamb slain for us&rdquo; in the
Apocalypse implies a recognized sacrament of lamb-eating, such as that
of the Passover, which was anciently the time for sacrificing
first-born sons (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2022:29">Ex. xxii,
29</a>), and which is explained even in the priestly myth as a
commemoration of the sparing of the first-born of Israel when the
first-born of Egypt were divinely destroyed. To such a national
precedent the Hebrew Jesuists would tend to cling as they did to the
practice of circumcision.</p>
<p class="par">But mere poverty on the one hand, and on the other the
then common ascetic instinct (which in some cases put water for wine),
would tell among Gentiles against the eating of actual flesh even when
the pretence was to eat flesh and drink blood. In some early Christian
groups accordingly the sacrificial food took the shape of a model of a
lamb in bread<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1371src" href="#xd21e1371"
name="xd21e1371src">6</a> (a kind of device often resorted to in pagan
worship with a special form of animal sacrifice), while others actually
ate a lamb and drank its blood, as did some of the Mithraists and some
of the Egyptian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>worshippers of Ammon. The Pauline phrase,
&ldquo;Our Passover also has been sacrificed, Christ&rdquo;&mdash;which
may or may not be an interpolation&mdash;would square with either
practice. But that Jews who had been wont to make much of a paschal
lamb, and who held Jesus to have represented that lamb, should pass at
once to a sacred meal of simple bread and wine or water, is unlikely;
and the gospels themselves indicate that a dish of another kind
preceded the bread and wine formality in the traditional Supper.</p>
<p class="par">Light is thrown on the original nature of the Jesuist
rite by the Paschal controversy in which the Eastern and Western
churches are found embroiled towards the end of the second century. It
turned nominally on the different accounts of the crucifixion in the
synoptics and the fourth gospel. Whereas the synoptics make Jesus take
the Passover with his disciples in due course, and die on the cross on
the first day (the Jewish day being reckoned from evening to evening),
the fourth gospel makes him sup informally with his disciples on the
day before the Passover, and die at the very hour of the paschal meal.
The idea obviously is that implied in the Pauline phrase already
quoted&mdash;that he is henceforth the substitute for the lamb; and in
actual fact the Eastern Christians of the second century are found
breaking their Easter fast on the Passover day, while the Westerns did
not break it till the Sunday of the resurrection. Evidently the Eastern
Christians had all along preserved an immemorial usage of eating their
eucharist on the Passover. They did not do this as orthodox Jews, for
they called their meal one of &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; in a Christist
sense, and their opponents did not charge them with Judaizing; but they
argued that they must take the eucharist at the time at which Jesus
took it with his disciples; while the Westerns contended that the time
for rejoicing and commemoration was the day of resurrection. The
explanation is that the story of Jesus eating with his disciples is a
myth of the kind always framed to account for an ancient ritual
practice; that the Jewish circumstances naturally gave the story a form
which made Jesus obey a Judaic ordinance; and that the Westerns, coming
newly into the cult, either recoiled from the procedure <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>of a
banquet on the very eve of the Lord&rsquo;s betrayal, or followed an
Adonisian or Attisian usage, in which the original sacrificial banquet,
though perhaps not abandoned, had been overshadowed by the &ldquo;love
feast&rdquo; on the announcement that &ldquo;the Lord has
arisen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In the nature of the case, the controversy was insoluble
by argument. The Easterns had always taken the Holy Supper at the time
of the Passover, and they had the gospel story telling them to repeat
it &ldquo;in remembrance&rdquo; of the Lord who so supped at the
Passover. The Westerns had the fourth gospel as their evidence that
Jesus actually died at the time of the Passover, thus constituting a
universal substitute for the Jewish sacrifice; and as in this gospel
there is no use of bread and wine, but merely the nondescript meal
which precedes the ritual in the synoptics, and in which the only
symbolic act is the giving of a &ldquo;sop&rdquo; to the betrayer, they
were left to practise the traditional eucharist in the way most
conformable to their feelings or to their pre-Christian usages. All
theory was finally lost sight of in the historic church, with its daily
celebration of the &ldquo;mass,&rdquo; which is the annual sacrifice
turned into a weekly and daily one; but from the whole discussion there
emerges the fact that the sacrifice is the oldest element in the cult,
antedating its biographical myths. And as the symbolic eating of bread
and wine as &ldquo;body and blood&rdquo; in the pagan cults is a late
refinement on a grosser practice of primitive sacrifice, so it was in
the Christist. As the wafer in the Catholic ritual is the attenuated
symbol of the bread of the mystic supper, so that bread was in turn an
attenuated symbol of an earlier object.</p>
<p class="par">When Christianity comes into aggressive competition with
Paganism, one of the common charges of its Roman enemies is found to be
that the Christians were wont to eat the body of an actual child in
their mysteries. There is no good reason to believe that this horror
ever happened among them; though the language of the rite tells of a
pre-historic practice of human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism, such
as actually took place among the early Semites and the pre-Christian
Mexicans, and was said to have been in use among the Druids about the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>beginning of the Christian era; but it is probable
that in some Christist groups there was a usage of eating a baked image
of a child, as had been done in the Dionysian mysteries. The
manipulation of the Abraham and Isaac legend, taken with other data in
the Pentateuch and elsewhere, makes it clear that child-sacrifice had
been practised among the early Hebrews as among the Ph&oelig;nicians,
and that the sacrifice of a lamb or kid became the equivalent, as it
was perhaps the prototype. When it was permitted to substitute a dough
image for the actual lamb, the mystical principle could be further
served by a dough image of the child that the lamb itself typified.
Under the veil of secrecy, which was as much a matter of course with
the early Christians as with the pagan initiates of the Eleusinian and
other mysteries, such variations of the cult were possible to an
indefinite extent. It was only when there grew up an ecclesiastical
organization, in the spirit and on the scale of the imperial system
itself, and when the compiled gospels had become a recognised code for
the Church in general, that they were reduced to the norm of the pagan
sacrament of bread and wine.</p>
<p class="par">The only other primary Christian rite, that of baptism,
is shown even in the gospels to have been pre-Christian; and the
anti-Judaic John the Baptist may have been a historic figure among the
Jews, though his connection with the Christos is a myth, seen in the
gospels in different stages of its development.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1394src" href="#xd21e1394" name="xd21e1394src">7</a> The
presumption is that it was framed at the stage at which the Jewish
Christists, faced by the Pauline and Gentile opposition to
circumcision, hitherto held binding among the Jesuists, decided to
substitute baptism (which already had a Jewish vogue) and thereby
maintain a Jewish primacy. But baptism too was a common Gentile usage,
as was the use of holy water, later adopted by the Christian
Church.</p>
<p class="par">With these Christist rites, it is clear, there was
originally associated a fixed belief in the speedily-approaching end of
the world, that being the notion which most completely pervades every
book in the New Testament. The rites then, like the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>similar
mysteries of the Pagans, were regarded as the way of entrance into the
future life, whether that were conceived as the apparition of a
supernatural New Jerusalem on earth, or as a transformed existence in a
material heaven in the skies. For the Pauline period, the approaching
catastrophe was evidently the supreme pre-occupation; and to the fear
of it the whole of the early Christian propaganda appealed. There is no
reason, however, to believe that the Christians at Jerusalem ever
&ldquo;had all things in common,&rdquo; as is asserted in the Acts of
the Apostles, where other passages confute the claim. Such communities
indeed had arisen in antiquity, and there was a kindred tradition that
Pythagoras had centuries before, in Italy, converted by one discourse a
multitude of hearers, who adopted a communal life. But the narrative in
the Acts, especially as regards the fable of Ananias and Sapphira,
seems to have been framed in the interest of some of the Christian
communist groups which arose after the period in question, and whose
promoters needed at once an apostolic precedent for their ideal and a
menace against those who temporized with it. In the Pauline epistles
the Gentile converts, so far from cultivating community of goods, are
seen going to law with each other before heathen judges.</p>
<p class="par">It is probable that the use of the sign of the cross, as
a mark of membership and a symbol of salvation, belonged to the
earliest stages of the cult; at least the sign in question figures as
the mark of a body of religious enthusiasts in Jewry as early as the
Book of Ezekiel (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ez%209:4">ix, 4</a>;
<i>Heb.</i>); and in the Apocalypse (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%207:2-3">vii, 2,
3</a>) the &ldquo;seal of the living God&rdquo; appears to have been
understood in the same sense as the sign prescribed in the prophecy.
The Hebrew letter <i>tau</i>, there specified, is known to have
represented at different periods different forms of cross; and the
oldest of all is believed to have been the <i lang="la">crux ansata</i>
of the Egyptians, which was a hieroglyph of immortal life. Thus the
historic form of the crucifix was determined, not by the actual manner
of normal crucifixion (for in that the arms were drawn above the head
and not outspread), but by previous symbolism. In the Egyptian ritual
of Osiris a spreading of the arms on the cross was in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>remote
antiquity a form of mystic regeneration; and in some amulets the
<i>stauros</i> or tree-cross of Osiris is found represented with human
arms.</p>

Gentile Christism</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A severance between the Jewish and the Gentile
Christists was the necessary condition of any wide spread of the cult.
Though it was the success of Jewish proselytism that paved the way for
the propaganda of Christism, only a handful of Gentiles would willingly
bow to the Jewish pretension of holding all the sources of
&ldquo;salvation.&rdquo; That a Gr&aelig;cized Jew, as Paul is
represented to have been, should begin to make the cult cosmopolitan,
in despite of opposition from Jerusalem, is likely enough; and
continued opposition would only deepen the breach. The Judaic claim
involved a financial interest; and as local economic interest was a
factor in the development of every Gentile group of Christists, a
theological argument for Gentile independence was sure to be evolved.
As the composition of the Christ-myth proceeded, accordingly, various
episodes to the discredit of the mythic twelve disciples of Jesus are
framed: &ldquo;one of the twelve&rdquo; figures as the betrayer; Peter
openly denies his Master, and the others forsake him in a body in the
hour of trial; while their incapacity to understand him in life is
often insisted on. John the Baptist and Jesus, again, are made
explicitly to teach that the &ldquo;Kingdom of God&rdquo; is taken away
from the Jews, though Jesus also promises the twelve that they shall
sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes. Finally, there is a
manipulation of narratives on the question of the responsibility for
Jesus&rsquo; execution, the outcome being that it lies neither with the
Roman governor nor with the sub-Roman king, but with the Jewish priests
and people, even as the life of the Child-God at his birth is menaced
by the Jewish King. In all likelihood most of those episodes were first
set forth in a Gentile Passion-play, whence they passed into the common
stream of tradition; but such an item as the part played by Pilate is
likely to have been first introduced from the Jewish side, Pilate
having been an object of special Jewish detestation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In such matters the literary or myth-making faculty of
the Gentiles, with their many Saviour-Gods, gave them the advantage
over the Judaists; but the strife of the two interests was long and
bitter. It flames out in the Judaic book of Revelation, in the allusion
to those who &ldquo;say they are apostles and are not&rdquo;; and long
after the time allotted to Paul we find him caricatured in certain
Judaizing writings, the so-called Clementine <i>Recognitions</i> and
<i>Homilies</i>, in the person of Simon Magus, an entirely unhistorical
personage, who also appears in the Acts of the Apostles. Simon Magus
is, in fact, a mythical figure evolved from Semo Megas or Great Sem
(=Sem-on, as Samson is Samas-on), an old Semitic Sun-God worshipped by
the polytheists of Samaria, and in connection with whose cultus there
was evidently a Gentile Christist movement, of a Gnostic or mythical
character, its Christ being conceived as non-human. Such a movement
being competitive with that of the Jewish Jesus, &ldquo;Simon,&rdquo;
to whom was ascribed an impressive Gnostic treatise, became the type of
anti-Jewish heresy; whence the late Christian story in the Acts, where
Elymas again (=Great El) is a mythical duplication of Simon.</p>
<p class="par">There are many signs that Samaritan elements entered
early into the Christist movement. The fourth gospel even represents
the founder to have been accepted in Samaria as the Messiah; and in so
far as the cult became Gentilised, even if the Ebionites did not stand
for an ancient local and quasi-Samaritan foundation, Samaritans would
be the more ready to join it, since they were thereby helping to
discomfit the more exclusive Jews. But they too had their Christ-myth;
and the conception of the Holy Spirit as a dove came from them to the
Christians. Seeking to found finally on the Old Testament, the
scripture-makers of the latter movement had to explain away their
Samaritan antecedents by myths of heresy.</p>
<p class="par">The book of Acts as a whole, however, stands for an
ecclesiastical tendency in the second century to make out that the
first apostles had not been divided; that Peter too was a preacher of
Gentile Christism, to which he had been converted by a vision; and that
Paul, in turn, had made concessions to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>Judaism. When the Judaic
Church became less and less dangerous as a possible monopolist, the
organizing Gentile churches could thus proceed to construct a theoretic
connection between Christianity and Judaism, the &ldquo;new
dispensation&rdquo; and the old, thus preserving for the new creed the
prestige of the Old Testament, with which, as a body of sacred books,
the New could not for a long time compete, even in the eyes of its
devotees. At the same time the apostles, who had long figured as
church-founders, were effectively glorified as wonder-workers, being
credited with miracles which rivalled those of the Christos himself;
and Peter raises a &ldquo;Tabitha&rdquo; from the dead as Jesus had
done the &ldquo;Talitha&rdquo; or maiden in the gospels&mdash;a myth
which was itself a duplicate of a traditional pagan miracle later
credited to Apollonius of Tyana.</p>
<p class="par">Alongside, however, of the systematizing or centripetal
process there went on a centrifugal one, the process of innovating
Gentile heresy. Already in Paul&rsquo;s epistles we read of
&ldquo;another Jesus&rdquo; whom the apostle &ldquo;had not
preached&rdquo;; and in the second century a dozen
&ldquo;Gnostic&rdquo; heresies were honeycombing the movement. Their
basis or inspiration was the mystic claim to inner light,
&ldquo;gnosis&rdquo; or knowledge, disparaged in the Pauline phrase
about &ldquo;knowledge [or science] falsely so-called.&rdquo; It was in
nearly all cases a combination of ideas current in the theosophies of
Asia and Egypt with the God-names of the Judaic and Christian cults. So
powerful was the instinct of independence, then as in later periods of
political change, that the spirit of Gnosticism, in a Judaic form,
found its way into the expanding gospels, where Jesus is at times made
to pose as the holder of a mystical knowledge, denied to the capacities
of the multitude, but conveyed by him to his disciples; who, however,
are in other passages reduced to the popular level of spiritual
incapacity. It cannot be doubted that the ferment thus promoted by what
the systematizers denounced as heresy helped at first to spread the
cult, at least in name, since all Christists alike would tend to resort
to the eucharist, or to the assemblies which were to develop into
Churches.</p>
<p class="par">At first the Jewish Christists may well have shared in
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>ordinary Jewish detestation of the Roman tyranny;
and for them Nero may have been &ldquo;Anti-Christ,&rdquo; as he
appears to be in the Apocalypse; but there is no good reason to suppose
that in Nero&rsquo;s day the historic Christians in Rome were a
perceptible quantity. Martyr-making later became an ecclesiastical
industry; and the striking passage in Tacitus which alleges the torture
and destruction of a &ldquo;vast multitude&rdquo; of Christians at
Nero&rsquo;s hands is nowhere cited in Christian literature till after
the printing, under suspicious circumstances, of the <i>Annals</i>. No
hint of such a catastrophe is given in the Acts of the Apostles. An
equivalent statement to that of Tacitus is first found in the chronicle
of Sulpicius Severus in the fifth century, where it is an expanded
episode in the midst of an extremely curt epitome. The similarly
suspicious passage on the same subject in Suetonius is put in further
perplexity by the same writer&rsquo;s statement that in the reign of
Claudius the Jews in Rome were constantly rioting, &ldquo;Chrestus
stirring them up&rdquo;&mdash;an expression which suggests, if
anything, that there was on foot in Rome a common Jewish movement of
Messianic aspiration, in which the Christ was simply expected as a
deliverer, apart from any such special cult as that of Jesus. It is
quite inapplicable to any such movement as is set forth in the Pauline
epistles. In any case, after the fall of Jerusalem Jesuist hopes were
visibly confined to the religious sphere; and Gentile Christianity
above all was perforce resigned to the imperial system, of which it was
one day to become a limb.</p>
<p class="par">There is seen too, even on the face of the Pauline
epistles, a superimposing of the new Greek terms and concepts on the
vocabulary of Jewish theology&mdash;terms of metaphysic and religion
such as <i>immortality</i>, <i>conscience</i>, <i>providence</i>,
<i>natural</i>, <i>corruptible</i>, <i>invisible</i>&mdash;and in the
language of the gospels and the Acts the Grecising influence becomes
more and more marked, increasing in the Acts and in the third gospel,
and becoming paramount in the fourth. The very conception of religious
as distinct from temporal salvation is Hellenistic or Persian rather
than Judaic; and the title of Saviour, which becomes the special
epithet of the Christ, is constituted as much by pagan usage
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>as by the original significance of the name Jesus.
Gentile also, rather than Judaic&mdash;though common to the pre-Judaic
Semites and the idolaters among the Hebrews&mdash;was the idea
expressed in the Pauline epistles that the Christist who partakes of
the mystic rite <i>suffers with</i> and henceforth is one with the
slain demigod, being &ldquo;crucified with Christ.&rdquo; That
conception is precedented generally in all the cults of ritual
mourning, notably in that of Osiris, and particularly in that of Attis,
in which the worshippers gashed themselves and punctured their hands or
necks; some of the priests even mutilating themselves as the God was
mutilated in the myth. The Pauline expression is to be understood in
the light of the passage in which a bitter censure, for having taken up
a false Christism, is passed on the Galatians, &ldquo;before whose eyes
Christ had been openly depicted, crucified&rdquo; (cp. <a class=

words &ldquo;among you,&rdquo; words which may either have been omitted
by late transcribers whom they embarrassed, or added by some one
desirous of accentuating the already emphatic expression of the
original. When we connect with these the further passage, usually taken
also without inquiry as purely metaphorical, in which Paul says he
&ldquo;bears branded on his body the marks of Jesus,&rdquo; we find
reason to surmise that, even as the ministrant in the Dionysian college
was called by the God&rsquo;s name, Bacchus; as the Osirian worshipper
spread himself on the cross and became one with Osiris; and as the
priest of Attis personated Attis in his mysteries&mdash;so Paul or
another personated Jesus in the mysteries of his sect; that what has so
long passed for verbal metaphor stood originally for a process of acted
symbolism; and that the theory of the mystery was that he who
personated the crucified demigod became specially assimilated to him.
The Pauline language on this head coincides exactly with the general
and primordial theory of theanthropic sacrifice: &ldquo;I have been
crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ
liveth in me.&rdquo; (Cp. <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil%203:11">Phil. iii,
11</a>.) Obscure and violent if understood as sheer metaphor, such
expressions fall into line with much ancient religious belief when read
as describing a symbolic rite. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33"
href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In any case, the first-cited passage seems to tell of
either a dramatic or a pictorial representation of the crucified Christ
in connection with the sacrament; a procedure which would probably not
be favoured by the art-hating Jews, but which, gradually developed
among the Gentiles in the fashion of the drama-loving Greeks, is the
probable origin of several of the gospel narratives. It belonged to the
conception of all such mysteries that their details should never be
divulged to outsiders; hence the rarity of such allusions, even in
letters to the faithful. The Christian cult adopted the very terms of
the heathen practice, and its initiates were called <i>myst&aelig;</i>,
like those of all the rival religions.</p>
<p class="par">A study of the early Christian tombs shows how much of
more or less unconscious compromise took place wherever Christism made
converts. The charming myth of Psyche had become for Pagans a doctrine
of immortality; and in that sense the figure of the child-goddess was
without misgiving carved on early Christian tombs. So with the figure
of Hermes Kriophoros, Hermes the Ram-Bearer, who is the true original
of the Christian conception of the Good Shepherd, in art and in
thought, though a figure of Apollo in the same capacity may have been
the medium of conveyance. Orpheus was assimilated in the same fashion;
and when art began to be applied to the needs of the new cult, Jesus
was commonly figured as a beardless youth, like the popular deities of
the Pagans in general.</p>
<p class="par">Last but not least of the Gentile elements which
determined the spread of the Christist cult was the double meaning
attaching to the Greek form of the Messianic name. In the unplausible
passage above cited from Suetonius, that is spelt Chr<i>e</i>stus,
evidently after the Greek word <i>Chr&#275;stos</i>=&ldquo;good,
excellent, gracious,&rdquo; which occurs frequently in the New
Testament, and which was a special title of the &ldquo;infernal&rdquo;
or underworld Gods of the Samothracian mysteries, also of Hermes, of
Osiris, and of Isis. The two words were pronounced alike; and the
coincidence is often such as would be made much of by ancient thinkers,
wont to lay great stress on words. In the gospel phrase so loosely
rendered &ldquo;my yoke is easy&rdquo; the Greek <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>adjective is <i>chr&#275;stos</i>; as also in that
translated: &ldquo;he is kind towards the unthankful and evil&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%206:35">Lk. vi,
35</a>); and in the phrase &ldquo;the Lord is gracious&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Pt%202:3">1 Pet.
ii, 3</a>). In the epistles, too, <i>chr&#275;stotes</i> is the word
used in the phrase &ldquo;the goodness of God&rdquo;; and in the
familiar Pauline quotation from Menander &ldquo;good manners&rdquo; is
in the Greek <i>chr&#275;sta &#275;th&#275;</i>. Among the Pagans,
again, this epithet constantly figured on the kind of tomb called
<i>her&#333;on</i>, erected to distinguished persons who thus received
the status of inferior deities or demigods, and who in consequence of
this very epigraphic formula came in later times to be regarded as
Christian martyrs, and to be so celebrated in festivals which were
really continuations of the pagan feasts in their honour. The
Christians themselves, on the other hand, habitually wrote their
founder&rsquo;s name <i>Chrestos</i> or <i>Chreistos</i> on their tombs
in the second and third centuries, thus assimilating it to the pagan
epigraphic formula <i>chr&#275;ste chaire</i>; and the term Christian
frequently followed the same spelling. Several of the Fathers, indeed,
make play with the double spelling, claiming that the terms are for
them correlative. So fixed was the double usage that to this day the
spelling of the French word <i>chr&eacute;tien</i> preserves the trace.
There was thus on the Christist side an appeal to Gentiles on the lines
of a name or badge already much associated with Gentile religion, and
attractive to them in a way in which the name &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; as
signifying &ldquo;one anointed&rdquo; would not be.</p>
<p class="par">How far this attraction operated may be partly inferred
from such a document as the apologetic treatise of Theophilus of
Antioch, conjecturally dated about the year 180, in which there is not
a single mention of Jesus as a basis of the Christian creed, while the
names Christos and Christian are repeatedly bracketed with
&ldquo;chr&#275;stos.&rdquo; The writer figures less as a Pauline
Christist than as a Gentile proselyte who founded on the Hebrew sacred
books, and believed in some impersonal Christ at once
&ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;anointed.&rdquo; Similarly in the Apology
of Athenagoras, belonging to the same period, the founder figures
purely as the divine <i>Logos</i>, not being even mentioned as a person
with a biography, though the writer quotes the Logos through an
apocryphal gospel. In such a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href=
"#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>propaganda the Greek associations
with the epithet <i>chr&#275;stos</i> would count for much more than
those of the Judaic standpoint.</p>
<p class="par">But above all other gains on this score may be reckoned
those made in Egypt, where the cult of the cross belonged alike to the
ancient worship of Osiris and the recent one of Serapis. Not only was
Osiris in especial <i>chr&#275;stos</i>, the benign God, but the
hieroglyph of goodness, applied to him in common with others, had the
form of a cross standing on a hillock (= a grave?), while the cross
symbol in another form was the sign of immortal life. In the imported
worship of Serapis, which inevitably conformed in the main to that of
Osiris, the cross was equally a divine and mystic emblem. It thus
becomes intelligible that some devotees of Serapis should, as is stated
in the well-known letter of the Emperor Hadrian, figure as bishops of
Christ; and that Serapis-worshippers should rank as Christians, their
God being like Osiris &ldquo;Chr&#275;stos.&rdquo; To gather into one
loosely-coherent mass the elements so variously collected was the work
of the gradually-developed hierarchical organization; and the process
involved a retention of some of the characteristics of the various
worships concerned.</p>
<p class="par">That there were yet other sources of membership for the
early Church, apart from direct conversion, is to be gathered from the
allegorical writing known as the <i>Pastor</i> of Hermas, which is
known to have been one of the most popular books in the whole Christian
literature of the second century. This work, apparently written in
Italy, never once mentions the name Jesus or the name Christ, and never
quotes from any book in either Testament, nor alludes to a crucifixion
or a eucharist; but speaks of One God, a Holy Spirit, and a Son of God
who underwent labours and sufferings; of a &ldquo;Church&rdquo; which
appears to mean the community of all good men; and of bishops and
apostles and presbyters. It is intelligible only as standing for some
species of pre-Jesuist propaganda very loosely related to Judaism,
inasmuch as it appears to cite some apocryphal Jewish work, yet utters
no Judaic doctrine. Its sole specified rite is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>baptism;
and its moral teaching barely recognizes the idea of vicarious
sacrifice. Such a work must have had its public before the Jesuist
movement took sectarian or dogmatic form; and its popularity in the
early Church must have come of the inclusion of its earlier following.
When the Church attained definite organization and a dogmatic system
the book was naturally discarded as having none of the specific
qualities of a Christian document.</p>
<p class="par">A &ldquo;Church&rdquo; such as is ambiguously set forth
in the <i>Pastor</i> may conceivably have been set up by one of the
movements of Samaritan Christism already mentioned, or by that
connected with the name of the Jew Elxai, who is recorded to have
written of &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; without making it clear whether he
referred to the gospel Jesus. As among the Elcesaites, so in the
<i>Pastor</i>, the &ldquo;Son&rdquo; is conceived as of gigantic
stature. On any view, being neither Christian nor anti-Christian, but
simply pre-Christian, yet turned to Christian uses, the book
strengthens the surmise that a number of the so-called heresies of the
early Church were in reality survivals of earlier movements which the
Church had absorbed, perhaps during times of persecution. The
&ldquo;heresy&rdquo; of Simon Magus was certainly such a pre-Christian
cult; that of Dositheus appears to be in the same case; and the ideas
of the <i>Pastor</i> conform to no canonical version of the Christian
creed.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">&sect; 7.</span> <i>Growth of the
Christ Myth</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Christist cult gained ground not because there
was anything new either in its dogma or in its promise, but on the
contrary because these were so closely paralleled in many pagan cults:
its growth was in fact by way of assimilation of new details from
these. Step by step it is seen to have adopted the mysteries, the
miracles, and the myths of the popular Gentile religions. The
resurrection of Jesus is made to take place like that of Mithra, from a
rock tomb; and to the sacred banquet of twelve represented by the Last
Supper there is added, in the fourth gospel, an episode which embodies
the common pagan usage of a sacred banquet of seven.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1586src" href="#xd21e1586" name="xd21e1586src">8</a> In
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>the way of miracle the Christ is made to turn
water into wine, as Dionysos had been immemorially held to do; he walks
on the water like Poseidon; like Osiris and Ph&oelig;bus Apollo he
wields the scourge; like the solar Dionysos, he rides on two asses and
feeds multitudes in the desert; like &AElig;sculapius, he raises men
from the dead, gives sight to the blind, and heals the sick; and like
Attis and Adonis he is mourned over and rejoiced over by women. Where
the parallel is not exact we still find pagan myth giving rise to
Christian; for the fable of the temptation is but a new story told of
the oft-copied ancient Babylonian astronomical symbol in which the
Goat-God (the sign of Capricorn) stands beside the Sun-God&mdash;a
scene turned by the Greeks into the myths of Pan leading Jupiter to the
mountain-top, of Pan or Marsyas competing with Apollo, and of Silenus
instructing Dionysos.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1594src" href=
"#xd21e1594" name="xd21e1594src">9</a> Above all, the Christ had to be
born in the manner of the ever-cherished Child-God of the ancient
world; he must have a virgin for mother, and he must be pictured in
swaddling-clothes in the basket-manger, preserved from immemorial
antiquity in the myth of Ion and in the cult of Dionysos, in which the
image of the Child-God was carried in procession on Christmas day. Like
Horos he must be born in a stable&mdash;the stable-temple of the sacred
cow, the symbol of the Virgin Goddess Isis, queen of heaven; and the
apocryphal gospels completed the pagan parallel by making the stable a
cave, the birthplace of Zeus and Mithra and Dionysos and Adonis and
Hermes and Horos.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1600src" href="#xd21e1600"
name="xd21e1600src">10</a> Prudence excluded the last detail from the
canonical gospels, but it became part of the popular faith; and the
Christ&rsquo;s birthday had been na&iuml;vely assimilated by the
populace to the solstitial birth-day of the Sun-God, December 25, long
before the Church ventured to endorse the usage.</p>
<p class="par">Judaic manipulation, however, was not lacking. Though
Jesus is born of a virgin, it is in the manner of Jewish theosophy; for
the &ldquo;Spirit of God&rdquo; broods over Mary as it had done on the
germinal deep in Genesis. Having been a Jewish Saviour before he was a
Gentile or Samaritan Christ, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href=
"#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>Jesus had further to satisfy as many
as possible of the Jewish Messianic requirements. He must be of the
line of David, and born at Bethlehem; but inasmuch as Jewish tradition
expected both a Messiah Ben-David and a Messiah Ben-Joseph&mdash;the
latter being apparently a Samaritan requirement<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1609src" href="#xd21e1609" name="xd21e1609src">11</a>&mdash;he
was made Ben-David by royal descent, and Ben-Joseph through his
putative father. Yet again, there being Messianists who denied the
necessity that the Anointed One should descend from David, there was
inserted in the gospels a story in which Jesus repudiates such descent;
the two opposed theories being thus alike harboured, without discomfort
and without explanation. In the same fashion the ascetics of the
movement made the Son of Man poor and homeless, while the anti-ascetics
made him a wine-drinker, ready to sit at meat with publicans and
sinners. For the Jews, too, he had to raise the &ldquo;widow&rsquo;s
son&rdquo; as did Elijah and Elisha in the Old Testament story&mdash;a
Hebrew variant of the (pictured?) Gentile myth of the raising of the
dead Attis or Adonis, or the dead child Horos or Dionysos, further
reproduced in the resurrection of the Christ himself; and there had to
be at his birth a massacre of the innocents, as in the myth of Moses
and in the Arab myths of the births of Abraham and Daniel. Yet again,
he had to figure in his crucifixion as bearing the insignia of royalty,
like the sacrificed &ldquo;only-begotten son&rdquo; of the Semitic God
El, and the sacrificed God-man of the Babylonian feast of
Sac&aelig;a.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1615src" href="#xd21e1615"
name="xd21e1615src">12</a> It may be that Barabbas, &ldquo;the son of
the father,&rdquo; is a survival of the same conception and the same
ritual usage, similarly imposed on a narrative of which no part is
historical.</p>
<p class="par">As with action, so with theory. In the East there had
long prevailed the mystical dogma that the Supreme God, who was above
knowledge, had incarnated himself in or created a deity representing
his mind in relation to men, the <i>Logos</i> or Word, in the sense of
message or revealed reason. Such was Mithra, the Mediator, in the
Mazdean system, whence apparently the conception originated; such was
Thoth in the theosophy of Egypt; such was Hermes, son of Maia and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>messenger of the Gods, in the pantheon of the
Greeks; and the Jews had long been assimilating the principle, partly
by making the deity figure as the <i>Logos</i> in human or angelic form
(as in <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2015">Gen. xv</a>);
partly in the form of a personalizing of <i>Sophia</i>, wisdom, as in
the books of Ecclesiastes and Proverbs and in the Old Testament
apocrypha; partly in the later form of a theoretic doctrine of the
<i>Logos</i>, as developed on the basis of Plato in the writings of
Philo the Jew of Alexandria, about the beginning of the Christian
era.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1643src" href="#xd21e1643" name=
"xd21e1643src">13</a> In the fourth gospel this doctrine is summarily
imposed on the Christist cult in an advanced form, though the three
synoptic gospels had shown no trace of it. The new myth was welcomed
like the others; all alike went to frame a deity who could compare and
compete with those of the other cults of the day.</p>
<p class="par">Doctrine followed the same law of assimilation; the
Christ must needs reflect in his teaching all the phases of the
religious thought of the age, however contradictory. First he had to
voice the Judaic hope of a kingdom of heaven, with stress laid on the
claims of the poor; he must insist on the speedy coming of the Judaic
doomsday and on his own function at the catastrophe; but yet again he
is made to present the kingdom of heaven as a kind of spiritual change;
and last of all he is made to utter the wisdom of the thinker who had
penetrated all the popular delusions and seen that &ldquo;the kingdom
of heaven is among you&rdquo;&mdash;or nowhere. In one gospel he
excludes Samaritans and Gentiles from his mission; in another he makes
a Samaritan the model &ldquo;neighbour&rdquo;; in another he goes among
the Samaritans in person. He becomes as manifold in doctrine as is
Apollo or Dionysos in function. Even when he is made to lay down, as
against Jewish superstition, the sane principle that victims of
fatalities are not to be reckoned worse sinners than other men, a later
hand appends a tag which reaffirms the very superstition impugned.
Every variety of ethic, within the limits of the Jewish and Gentile
ideals of the time, is imposed on him in turn. Alternately
particularist and universalist, a bigoted Jew and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>a
cosmopolitan, a lover of the people and a Gnostic despiser of their
ignorance, a pleader for love to enemies and a bitter denouncer of
opponents; successively insisting on unlimited forgiveness and on the
ostracism of recalcitrant brethren, on the utter fulfilment of the
Mosaic law and on its supersession; alternately promising and denying
temporal blessings, avowing and concealing his belief in his
Messiahship; prescribing by turns secrecy and publicity to his
auditors, blind faith and simple good works to his disciples&mdash;he
is the heterogeneous product of a hundred mutually frustrative hands, a
medley of voices that never was and could not be in one personality.
Through his supernatural mask there speak the warring sects and ideals
of three centuries: wisdom and delusion, lenity and bitterness,
ventriloquize in turns in his name. Even as the many generations of
Jewish teachers had preluded all their changing counsels with a
&ldquo;thus saith the Lord,&rdquo; so did their Christist successors
seek to mint their cherished dogmas, their rigid prejudices, and their
better inspirations, with the image and superscription of the new
Logos, the growing God of a transforming world. The later product is
thus as unreal as the older.</p>
<p class="par">It is only on presuppositions themselves the fruit of
belief in the myth that such a growth seems unlikely or impossible, or
that something supernormal is needed to account for the wide
development of the Christian system. Those who look upon the historic
flood in the broad and peopled plain are slow to conceive that it had
its rise in the minute rills and random brooks of a far-off mountain
land. But it is so that the great rivers begin. <span class=

Mental Conditions in the Roman Empire</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The world in which Christianity grew up was above
all things one of extinguished nationalities, of obliterated
democracies, of decaying intellectual energy. Wherever the Roman Empire
spread, a rigid limit was set to the play of public spirit, whether as
criticism of the political order or as effort to improve the social
structure. The forms of municipal government remained; but the natural
and progressive struggle of classes and interests was at an end. The
Jew must give up his polity of applied theocracy; the Greek his ideal
of the City State; even as the Roman Senate itself shrank into an
assembly of sycophants, content to register its master&rsquo;s decrees.
All alike, on pain of extinction, must mutely or fawningly accept the
imperial system, and abandon hope of shaping their own political
destinies. In such a world the thinking faculty, denied almost all
exercise on the living problems of polity and conduct, necessarily
turned to the themes that were open to it; and as the very calibre of
men&rsquo;s minds had narrowed with the suppression of their freedom,
which meant the curtailment of their personality, there was no such
general faculty available as could grasp the difficult problems of
science and philosophy led up to by the hardy speculation of the ages
of freedom and by the skilled specialism of the endowed students of
pre-Roman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>Alexandria. For the mass of the people, above all,
save where the Greek drama was still presented to them, concrete
religion was the one possible form of mental life; and for the more
serious such mental life was at once a solace and a preoccupation.
Under a despotism which in so many ways conformed to oriental types,
serious men developed something of the oriental aloofness from the
actual: from action they turned to brooding; from seen interests to the
problems of the unseen. Even in Rome itself, where the upper classes
were much more indifferent to Christism than those of the Eastern
provinces, the new conditions developed a new interest in theological
problems on the pagan side.</p>
<p class="par">Broadly speaking, types and classes of men have always
been meditatively religious or reflective in the degree of their
exclusion from practical concerns. In the ancient world the law reveals
itself at every vista. At one extreme stood the energetic Romans,
sedulous first in agriculture and later in warfare; superstitious but
unspeculative; making ritual religion a methodical province of polity,
a part of the mechanism of the republic: at the other the Hindus,
predestined to despotism by their physical and economic conditions, and
to inaction by their climate, the true children of reverie, for whom
religious evolution was a deepening absorption in boundless
speculation. Midway stood the Greeks, active but not laborious, too
alive for much brooding and too cultured for wholly pedantic
superstition, the natural framers of a religion of poetry and art.
Their science and philosophy began in Asia Minor, on the soil of the
half-scientific, half-religious lore of the overthrown Assyrian and
Babylonian cultures of the past, in a leisurely and half-oriental
atmosphere; and after the first free evolution of its germs in the
manifold life of their countless competitive City States, the most
notable growth of their philosophy was in the period when their
political failure began to declare itself, and the shadow of despotism
was falling on men sobered and chagrined by the spectacle of ceaseless
intestine strife. When despotism was fixed, thought still progressed
for a time in virtue of the acquired stores of culture and stress of
impulse; but in that air the higher life soon flagged, and philosophy
for the most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>part lapsed to the levels of ancient mysticism,
becoming a play of fantasy instead of an effort of critical reason.</p>
<p class="par">When the cultured few underwent such a destiny, the
uncultured crowd could but feed on the simpler religious doctrine that
came in their way. It necessarily ran to a more intimate employment of
the standing machinery of the creeds, to a use of the more emotional
rites, to a freer participation in the consolations and excitements of
the dramatic mysteries. Where civic life was precarious without being
self-ruling, the more serious came more and more under the sway of the
oriental preoccupation over the future&mdash;a habit of mind developed
in lands subject to chronic conquest and to the caprice of tyrants and
satraps. Growing Greece, while free, had taken from the East, centuries
before the Christian era, stimulating and emotional cults, especially
dear to women, with mysteries which promised to their initiates a
blessed life beyond the troublous present; and by a natural tendency
those who had least share in controlling the present clung most to such
comfort. So, in republican Rome, it was found that the women and the
imported slaves were always most hospitable to a new
&ldquo;superstition&rdquo;; and in times of dangerous war the
proclivity quickened.</p>
<p class="par">In this way there went on a kind of religious
enfranchisement in the Mediterranean world both before and after the
Romans became the universal masters. In the early City States of Greece
and Italy, but especially in Rome, worship was originally in large
measure a privilege of rank. The most constant and intimate worship was
naturally that of the household Gods, the <i>Lares</i> and
<i>Penates</i>; and the men with no ancestral home, whether slaves or
paupers, were outside of such communion. Only in the worship of the
Gods of the city was there general communion; and even here the
patrician orders long monopolised the offices of ministry in Rome;
while even in more democratic Greece, with some exceptions, the slaves
and the foreign residents were excluded from the sacred banquet which
was the mark of all cults alike, public or private. Even the first
imported cults were put under a civic control, which doubtless promoted
decorum, but also made for class <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44"
href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>interests. In later republican
Rome the usage prevailed of bringing to the sacred banquet-table the
statues of the Gods, who were believed to partake with the worshippers;
and the company was naturally kept very select. For the Roman common
people, accordingly, religious association was mainly confined to the
worship of the public <i>Lares</i> and <i>Penates</i> instituted for
their benefit. In Greece the city banquet was liberalised with the
progress of democracy; but at best it was the heritage of the free
citizens; and the antique simplicity of its rites must have made it
lack emotional atmosphere. At times it was even necessary to practise
compulsion to secure the due attendance of &ldquo;parasites&rdquo; at
the smaller sacramental repasts (pagan types of the daily
&ldquo;mass&rdquo;) held daily in the temples, which would lack the
attraction of the public feasts.</p>
<p class="par">Thus it came about that in the course of the ages the
common people, especially the many aliens from Asia Minor, slave and
free, everywhere tended to seek more and more a religion for
themselves&mdash;something in which they could share equally and
intimately; somewhat as, in a later period, the common people in so
many parts of Europe recoiled from official Catholicism before as well
as at the Reformation, or as the townspeople in England later set up
their own dissenting chapels in dislike of the Established Church. As
early as the Peloponnesian war we find new religious societies arising
among the humbler Athenians, making accessible to them Dionysian or
other eastern mysteries of sacred baptism, and a sacred banquet of
&ldquo;body and blood,&rdquo; in which a kid was the victim. Some such
banquet was the normal basis; and the societies, which were numerous,
were self-supporting and self-governing, appointing their own priests
or priestesses, and keeping their own sacred books. In these cults
slaves, aliens, and women were alike admitted; and, though in some the
worship was orgiastic, in keeping with the then common level of popular
culture, it is not to be supposed that the avowed ideals of
&ldquo;goodness, chastity, piety,&rdquo; were for such groups in
general devoid of moral significance. They were condemned by the
educated classes alike in republican Greece and in republican Rome as
vulgar and licentious; but if these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>imputations are to be fully
believed as against the pagan societies, they must be equally believed
as against the Christians, concerning whom, in turn, they were
generally made in the second and third centuries. Of neither movement,
probably, were they more than partially true. In any case, the Greek
societies gave a model to the early Christian churches in more than one
point of organisation, most of them having had &ldquo;presbyters&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;bishop&rdquo; (<i>episcopos</i>), and some being called
&ldquo;synagogues,&rdquo; a term synonymous with <i>ecclesia</i>. So
great, finally, became the competitive pressure of the private cults
that those of the State had to offer inducements as against them; and
in course of time the once exclusive Eleusinian mysteries of Athens
were opened to all members of the State, and latterly&mdash;save in
exceptional cases, such as those of avowed unbelievers, or Epicureans,
or Christians&mdash;to all members of the Roman empire. Even the
slaves, finally, were initiated at the public expense.</p>
<p class="par">So far as the gospels can be taken to throw light on
Christian beginnings, the cult grew up under conditions similar to
those above described. Some of &ldquo;the poor&rdquo; in Jewry as
elsewhere felt themselves in a manner outside the established worship;
and though declamation against the rich had long been popular, the
names given to the legendary disciples suggest that there too the new
cults were in large measure promoted by aliens. The accounts of the
founder as mixing much with &ldquo;tax-gatherers and sinners&rdquo;
tell of the presence of such in the sect; and there too the constant
presence of women stood for a sense either of feminine dissatisfaction
with the bareness of the official worship, or of the need for a
personal recognition which Judaism did not give to the subordinate sex.
It does not appear that slaves were similarly welcomed in the Jewish
stage of the movement; portions of the gospels even make Jesus appeal
to the ideals of the slave-owner<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1710src"
href="#xd21e1710" name="xd21e1710src">1</a>; and nowhere is the slave
himself sympathetically brought to the front. But it is clear that when
the cult entered on a Gentile development it admitted slaves like the
religious societies of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46"
name="pb46">46</a>]</span>the Greeks; and in the first Gentile period
the members appear to have paid their way and managed their own affairs
in the democratic Greek fashion.</p>
<p class="par">The determining political condition everywhere was the
social sway of the empire, keeping all men impotent in the higher
public affairs. Exclusion from public life, broadly speaking, had been
the cause of the special addiction of the women, the slaves, and the
unenfranchised foreigners of the Greek cities and of Rome to private
cults and communions. Under the empire, all the lay classes alike were
excluded from public power; and new interests must be found to take the
place of the old. Within the pale of the Roman &ldquo;peace,&rdquo;
those interests were summed up for the majority in athletics, the
theatre and the circus on the one hand; and on the other in the field
of religious practices. Hopes of betterment, and despair after vain
revolt, were alike fuel for the religious spirit; since the hope turned
to vaticination, and the despair crept for shelter to the mysteries
that promised a better life beyond the grave. But the prevailing lot of
men had become one of unwarlike submission; the material refinements of
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1722" title=
"Source: civilisation">civilization</span> had bred in the cities a new
sensitiveness, indeed a new neurosis; vice itself set up reactions of
asceticism; and over all there brooded the pessimism of the prostrate
East, the mood of men downcast, consciously the puppets of an
uncontrollable earthly destiny, and wistful for a higher vision and
rule.</p>

Orthodoxy</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Between the new sect and the normal or established
Jewish religion, which had contained within it or was easily adaptable
to every element that went to make early Jesuism, the force of
separation was not doctrinal or intellectual, but political and
economic. Save for the later-evolved concept of an
Incarnation&mdash;which also, however, was foreshadowed in Jewish
thought&mdash;there is almost no principle in the Christian system that
was not to be found either in the sacred books or in the current
rabbinical teaching of the Jews, whose development is to be measured no
less by the liberal ethical teaching of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>such rabbis as Hillel
than by the mere traditionalism ascribed to the mass of the scribes and
Pharisees. Their sacred books spoke sympathetically of the poor; and
their sacred treasury must have fed many, although&mdash;as in the days
of the prophets and in our own time in Europe&mdash;there were many
irreconcilables. Even among the Pharisees there were some who
proclaimed the &ldquo;law of the heart&rdquo; as the highest. As
regarded religious thought, the Jews&rsquo; system of sacrifice on the
one hand, and their higher or supra-ecclesiastical ethic on the other,
provided for all the forms of bias appealed to in the gospels and
epistles, with the one exception of the kind of sentiment which sought
a Demigod rather than a God; a humanly sympathetic divinity, acquainted
with griefs, rather than a remote and awful Omnipotence. Even this
figure was partly evolved on Jewish lines, in the conception of a
Messiah who should suffer and die. But a Messiah who died and did not
soon come again in triumph had no easily tenable place in the Jewish
system; and when the cult of such a Messiah came into Gentile vogue,
especially after the ruin of Jerusalem, it was necessitated either to
take a new and substantive status outside of Jewry or disappear
altogether. It is true that the so-called Nestorians (properly
Nazar&aelig;ans) of Armenia have reconciled Judaism with Christism by
defining the sacrifice of Jesus as the final sin-offering, while
maintaining the other sacrifices of the Mosaic law; but that course was
impossible to the hierarchy accused of causing the crucifixion; and the
Nestorians were as anti-Jewish as other Christians.</p>
<p class="par">Judaism, so to speak, was riveted at once to its
national and to its economic basis. Its primary appeals to Gentile
proselytes were those of a great historic shrine and a body of sacred
literature; and on both grounds the clerical class of Jerusalem claimed
a revenue from the faithful, Hebrew or proselyte. Financial interest
secured that the converted alien should be treated as the more liberal
prophetic literature urged; but it was of the essence of Judaism that
the temple or the Patriarchate should be the fiscal headquarters of all
the faithful; and herein lay a moral as well as a financial limit.
Ordinary racial instinct, and ordinary Gentile self-interest,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>must tend to clash with such claims in the case of
rabbinical Judea as in that of Papal Rome; and the merely moral or
ideal character of the Judaic influence, coupled with the effect of the
common Gentile disesteem for the Jewish personality, brought it about
that the Romanism of Jewry, always the more restricted, collapsed by
far the more swiftly. The later collapse of Jewish Jesuism was a
phenomenon of the same order.</p>
<p class="par">Early Jesuism, it is clear, flourished as a new means of
Jewish proselytism among the Gentiles; and the fact best established by
the dubious literature which surrounds the &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; is
that their Gentile converts were expected to contribute to
headquarters, just as did the ordinary Jew. Even after a Gentile
differentiation had definitely begun, whether under Paul or at the
hands of others who forged in his name, it was Jewish forces that did
the work so far as literature went. Throughout the synoptic gospels the
notion given of the Messiah&rsquo;s function is for the most part
latter-day Jewish; he is to preside over the approaching day of
judgment, and his apostles are to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
The early Jesuists, accordingly, must have held themselves included in
the Judaic fold. All sections alike, down to the rise of anti-Jewish
Gnosticism, founded on the Jewish sacred books in the Greek
translation; a moral manual of the Jewish Twelve Apostles, as we have
seen, served as a Jesuist handbook; and the ethic of the gospels is
throughout, even in its contradictions, substantially a Jewish product.
If John the Baptist could reject the racial pride and prejudice of the
Jews as he is alleged to have done, universalism had already begun
within the Jewish field. Even on the point of opposition to
divorce&mdash;an attitude deriving from non-Jewish rather than from
Jewish ideals&mdash;there were elements in Jewry on which to found as
against the looser orthodox practice; and it is quite likely that the
absolute as well as the qualified prohibition in the gospels came from
Jewish pens. Thus the moral and religious atmosphere of Judaism in
general was perfectly compatible with the early Jesuist way of life. It
is a sectarian fallacy to assume that the repellent aspects typified by
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>&ldquo;Scribes and Pharisees,&rdquo; or even by
the shambles of the Temple, were primary grounds for a moral revolt
among Jews and proselytes, or that Jesuism so began. The types of the
worse scribes and Pharisees were very speedily developed in the new
sect, as in every other; and such Jesuists as are portrayed in the
First Epistle to the Corinthians cannot be supposed to have rejected
Judaism on the score of its moral crudity. What they were much more
likely to resent was its demand for tribute concurrently with its
disparagement of the Gentile proselyte; and, last but not least, its
barbarous rite of circumcision, for which even the pro-Jewish Jesuists
had finally to substitute baptism.</p>
<p class="par">The relation of Judaism to Jesuism, then, was somewhat
as that of a mother country to a colony; the latter growing by help of
the former, deriving from it speech, lore, ideals, methods, models, and
prestige, till in time the new environment elicits special
characteristics, and mere geographical division no less than
self-interest vetoes the payment of the old tribute. As usual, there
was in the colony a loyalist party which bitterly resisted the
severance.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">&sect; 3.</span> <i>Jewish Sects:
the Essenes</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">While Josephus specifies four Jewish
&ldquo;sects,&rdquo; there was in Jewry really only one dissenting sect
in the modern sense of the term, apart from the Jesuists. Pharisees and
Sadducees were analogous rather to the sections or
&ldquo;schools&rdquo; of the Churches of Rome and England, the former
being &ldquo;orthodox and more,&rdquo; inasmuch as they held by the
law, but further insisted on the doctrine of a future state, which was
not contained in the Mosaic books; while the Sadducees, either from
pre-Maccabean conservatism or from Hellenistic scepticism, held by the
pure Mosaic system, of which, being for the most part of priestly
status, they were the main administrators. It is noteworthy that it is
the Pharisees, who held the tenet of a future life, rather than the
Sadducees, who rejected it, that are most acrimoniously handled in the
gospels: the former being naturally the most dangerous competitors of
the new cult within the Jewish pale. A third body mentioned by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>Josephus, that of Judas the Galilean, was rather a
political than a religious party, being bent simply on maintaining the
Jewish nationality as against the Romans.</p>
<p class="par">The term &ldquo;sect,&rdquo; however, to some extent
applies to the Essenes, whose existence and characteristics are
specially noteworthy in connection with Christian beginnings. All the
evidence goes to show that there had existed in Jewry for many
generations a body so named (or perhaps formerly called
<i>Chassidim</i>), living an ascetic life, rejecting animal food and
animal sacrifices, avoiding wine, warm baths, and oil for anointing,
wearing white garments and preferring linen to wool, forbidding all
oaths save one, and greatly esteeming celibacy. Many of them lived in a
male celibate community, by their own labour, with community of goods,
on the shores of the Dead Sea, under a strict hierarchical rule; but
many others lived scattered through the Jewish cities, some marrying,
but all maintaining ascetic principles. To secure entrance into the
community there was needed a long probation. On the side of creed they
held firmly by the law of Moses, yet also reverenced the sun, to which
they sang a morning hymn of praise; strictly observed the Sabbath;
conducted their religious services without priests, and studied magic
and angelology, but tabooed logic and metaphysics. Ethically the cult
was in the main one of physical purity and fraternal humility, hostile
to slavery and war as well as to the normal vices, but running to
mysticism on the line of a belief, often seen in early religion, that
asceticism could raise men to supernatural powers. As a whole, the
system had so much in common with that of the Pythagoreans on the one
hand, and with the Mazdean religion and Buddhism on the other, that it
must be held to prove a connection between these, and to point to a
movement which once spread over Asia as far as Buddhist India, and over
the Mediterranean world as far as early Grecian Italy, surviving for
many centuries in scattered sects.</p>
<p class="par">It thus appears that, without the intervention or even
the tradition of any quasi-divine personality, there could subsist in
Jewry a cult which outwent the Christist in point of asceticism and
humility, attaining the kind of fraternity at which the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>latter
ostensibly but vainly aimed, and maintaining itself for many
generations on substantially celibate lines, partly by accessions from
without under a rigid probation, and partly by the adoption and
education of children. Such a system, expressly aiming at selection and
exclusion, negated the idea of a world religion, and, though it was
still standing in the fifth century, could not survive the final ruin
of its environment, save as an ideal passed on to Christian
monasticism. But its long duration serves to make clear the range of
possibilities open to religious movements in Palestine and the East
apart from any abnormal gifts of leadership or any semblance of
supernatural innovation.</p>
<p class="par">How far Essenism reacted on early Jesuism cannot be
ascertained. Despite some approximations, such as the veto on oaths and
the esteem for celibacy, it is clear that there was no such close
resemblance between the movements as has been supposed by the writers
who seek to identify them; but they tell of a similar mental climate.
The non-mention of Essenism in the gospels is to be explained by the
fact that the two systems were not rivals. One was localized, monastic,
exclusive; the other peregrine and propagandist: and only in the minds
of the ill-informed Roman forgers of the second century could they be
supposed to have come into hostile contact. Essenism needed no
innovating Messiah; and Jesuism had to go afield for adherents.</p>

Cults</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">What Christism had to compete with in the
Greco-Roman world was not so much the collective principle of
polytheism or the public worship of the endowed temples, as the class
of semi-private cults to which itself belonged, and the popular
worships equally associated with suffering and dying Saviour-Gods. Of
these the most prominent were the ancient worships of the Syrian
Adonis, the Phrygian Attis, Dionysos, and the Egyptian Osiris, all of
which had become partly assimilated in theory, in ritual, and in public
observance. But contemporarily with Christianity there began also to
spread through the empire the Persian cult of Mithra, which had been
first introduced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>into the Roman army after the Mithridatic wars;
and in the end this became the most dangerous rival of the new church.
All six cults alike gave prominence to the idea of the God&rsquo;s
death and resurrection; and all lived in a common atmosphere of ancient
superstition, emotional unrest, craving for communion, anxious concern
for the future and for the washing out of guilt by religious rites and
penances. And all six deities were nominally &ldquo;born of a
virgin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Of the competing cults in the East the least developed
in a theological sense were those of Attis and Adonis, originally
deities of the Vegetation principle, whose annual death and
resurrection stood primarily for the yearly decay and rebirth of the
general life of Nature, and secondarily for the waning and waxing of
the power of the sun. While all cults in the ancient world tended to
assimilate, however, the older were marked by certain special usages;
and in the case of Attis and Adonis these were the festivals which
began with mourning and ended in rejoicing. Attis, son of the virgin
Myrrha, was symbolized by the cut pine-tree, which meant the life
principle in man and Nature; and at the spring equinoctial festival
this was carried in procession to the temple of Cybel&ecirc; with the
effigy of a young man bound on it, to represent the dead and mutilated
God. Anciently, it would seem, there had been so bound an actual youth
who was slain as a victim, and whose death was supposed to ensure at
once physical fertility and moral well-being to his land and people;
but in virtue of the general law of mitigation a mystic ceremony at
length took the place of the primitive deed of blood. The bearing of
the God&rsquo;s name by his priests in the mysteries was a memorial of
the older time.</p>
<p class="par">These mysteries were twofold. In the spring time Attis
figured as a self-slain youth, beloved by Cybel&ecirc;, the Mother of
the Gods, and devoted to her cultus. Later in the year he figured as
<i>Papas</i>, &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; and Lord of All; and in this aspect
he was more important than Cybel&ecirc;, who was throned beside him in
the mystic drama, with a crowd of women around. The initiate became
<i>mystes Atteos</i>, the initiate of Attis; and at this stage the God
was adored as the bringer of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href=
"#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>peace to a disorderly world. But
&ldquo;many were the thyrsus-bearers; few were the <i><span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1792" title=
"Source: mystae">myst&aelig;</span></i>&rdquo;: it was the spring
festival that dwelt in the common knowledge and memory; and then it was
that, after a day of procession and mourning, a day of solemn rites,
and a &ldquo;day of blood&rdquo; on which the high-priest cut his arms
and presented his blood as an offering, the slain Demigod rose from the
dead, and all was rejoicing for his resurrection. It was the great
Phrygian festival; and though the Romans, in introducing the worship of
the Great Mother while Hannibal maintained himself in Italy, nominally
accepted her alone, it was impossible that the allied worship of Attis
should be excluded from the later mysteries. The <i>galli</i> or
mutilated priests, who figured in her <i>Hilaria</i> festival, were in
fact the God&rsquo;s representatives. Thus his was one of the popular
cults of the later Roman world.</p>
<p class="par">Bound Adonis, the Tammuz of old Assyria, there had
played for long ages a more tender devotion. For the Syrians his name
meant &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; (=the <i>Adonai</i> of the Hebrew Bible);
and over the tale of his untimely slaughter by the boar on Mount
Lebanon the Eastern women had yearly wept for a hundred generations.
The &ldquo;women weeping for Tammuz&rdquo; in the temple of Jerusalem
before the exile were his worshippers; and in the Athens of the days of
the Peloponnesian war he received the same litany of mourning. For his
sacred city of Byblos he was as it were the soul and symbol of the
yearly course of Nature; the annual reddening of the Adonis river by
the spring floods being for his devotees a mystery of his shed blood.
Then came the ritual of grief, in which his wooden and painted effigy,
lying with that of Aphrodit&ecirc;, the Goddess who loved him, took the
place of the victim in the older rite in which he too was doubtless
slain &ldquo;for the people.&rdquo; The &ldquo;gardens of
Adonis,&rdquo; shallow trays in which various green plants grew quickly
and as quickly died, had been originally charms to hasten the fertility
of the spring, like the sacrifice itself; but long custom made them
mere symbols of untimely death, and the cult was one of pathos and
compassion, passing in the usual way to exultation and gaiety when,
after his effigies had been thrown as corpses into the sea or the
springs, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>God rose from the dead on the third day, and in
the presence of his worshippers, by some mummery of make-believe or
mechanical device, was represented as ascending to heaven. As in the
cult of Attis, it was women who &ldquo;found&rdquo; the risen Lord,
whose death they had mourned.</p>
<p class="par">In such worships, it will be seen, much depended on the
spirit of sex, which was evoked by the pairing of God and Goddess, a
common principle of the ancient Semitic pantheon, here subtilized by
romance. Such myths as those of Attis and Adonis, indeed, lent
themselves to contrary emotions, the amorous and the ascetic passions
figuring in the devotees by turns. Thus the very eunuch priests who
represented the extremity of anti-sexualism were credited with a mania
of licentiousness; and on the other hand the Great Mother, who in the
primitive myth was enamoured of Attis, and yet in one version mutilated
him, was by her graver devotees regarded in a holier light. So even
Aphrodit&ecirc;, the lover of Adonis, had her supernal aspect as
Urania; and the legend of the indifference of Adonis, like that of the
self-mutilation of Attis, conveyed a precept and pattern of chastity.
Everywhere, as the world grew sophisticated, and the primitive
simplicity of appetite was overborne by pessimism and asceticism, the
cruder cults tended to become refined and the Goddess-worships grew in
dignity. At the sacred city of Hierapolis, in Syria, there was long
worshipped a Goddess of immemorial fame, round whose history there
floated myths like those of Cybel&ecirc; and Aphrodit&ecirc;, Attis and
Adonis, but whose prestige was apparently maintained rather by
minimising than by retailing them. In her cult all the worshippers were
wont to puncture their hands or necks, probably in mystic imitation of
a slain Demigod such as Attis, connected with her legend; and in her
service ascetic priests or hermits ascended phallic pillars to win
sanctity by vigils of a week long. Thus was set up for the Goddess a
religious renown comparable to that of Yahweh of Jerusalem, bringing
multitudes of strangers to her every festival, and filling the
treasuries of her priests with gifts.</p>
<p class="par">Of kindred character and equivalent range with the cults
of Attis and Adonis was that of Dionysos, the most many-sided
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>of the divinities adopted by the Greeks from Asia.
Figuring first as Bacchus, a Thracian God of beer,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1815src" href="#xd21e1815" name="xd21e1815src">2</a> and later
as the God of wine, he seems to have made way in early Greece partly by
virtue of the sheer frenzy set up in his women worshippers by unwonted
potations. But such phenomena caused their own correction; and the
adoption of the cult by the cities brought it within the restraining
sway of Greek culture. Of all the older Greek worships, the most
popular was that (perhaps oriental in origin) of
D&ecirc;m&ecirc;t&ecirc;r and Persephon&ecirc;, the Mourning Mother and
the Virgin Daughter, who had primarily signified mother earth and the
seed corn; and with their worship in the great Eleusinian mysteries was
bound up that of Dionysos. Son of Zeus and the Virgin Goddess
Persephon&ecirc; or the mortal virgin Semel&ecirc;&mdash;for the myths
were legion&mdash;he was carried in effigy as a new-born babe in a
manger-basket on the eve of the winter solstice. In this capacity he
was pre-eminently the Babe-God, Iacchos, &ldquo;the suckling.&rdquo;
Further, he figures in one myth as being torn to pieces by the
Titans,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1821src" href="#xd21e1821" name=
"xd21e1821src">3</a> and as restored to life or reborn (after Zeus has
terribly avenged him) by his mother Semel&ecirc; (really an old
Earth-Goddess) or by the Mother-Goddess, D&ecirc;m&ecirc;t&ecirc;r;
wherefore he is represented as a suckling at
D&ecirc;m&ecirc;t&ecirc;r&rsquo;s breast. In the triennial dramatic
mysteries in his honour an eating of raw flesh by the devotees was held
to commemorate his sacrificial death, which was, however, mystically
conceived to mean the making of wine from grapes. In other and commoner
forms of the sacred banquet, the wine figured specially as his blood,
and the bread as D&ecirc;m&ecirc;t&ecirc;r=Ceres; and in this
transparent form the symbolism of &ldquo;body and blood&rdquo; was a
household word among the Romans. In their popular religion, being
assimilated to an ancient Roman God, the Wine-God was known as Liber,
&ldquo;the child,&rdquo; as &ldquo;Father Liber,&rdquo; and as Bacchus,
while Ceres or Proserpine was paired with him as <i>Libera</i>. The
doctrine, found among the Manich&aelig;ans in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>fourth
century, that &ldquo;Jesus hangs on every tree,&rdquo; is in all
likelihood a development from this worship, in which Dionysos was God
of the vine in particular, but of all vegetation besides. For such
mystics as wrote and conned the Orphic hymns, however, he was a God of
manifold potency; and there centred round him a whole theosophy of
ascetic ethic, in which the ideal of the worshipper was to strive,
suffer, and conquer in common with the God, who was the giver of
immortality.</p>
<p class="par">Of his cult in particular it is difficult to grasp any
general significance, so inextricably did it become entwined with
others, in particular with the Phrygian cult of Sabazios,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1834src" href="#xd21e1834" name="xd21e1834src">4</a>
and with the Corybantic mysteries, in connection with which are to be
traced a whole series of local deities of the same stamp as those under
notice, just as the myth of Apollo can be seen to have absorbed a whole
series of local Sun-Gods. Thus the mortal Jasion or Iasious is slain by
Zeus for being the lover of Cybel&ecirc;, who however bears to him a
divine son, Korybas; and he in turn figures also as the son of the
Virgin Persephon&ecirc;, and without father, human or divine. In the
Orphic hymns Korybas is the mighty Lord of the underworld, who frees
the spirit from all terrible visions, a giver of blessedness and of
sorrow, a God of double nature. So Dionysos, like the Hindu Fire-God
Agni, is born of two mothers; and like Hermes and Herakles he has
descended to Hades and returned, victorious over death. In all such
cults alike is to be noted the gradual emergence of the relation of
maternity as well as paternity, the Mother Goddess coming more and more
to the front as such; while the Son-God, in the case of Dionysos and
D&ecirc;m&ecirc;t&ecirc;r, tends to overshadow or supersede the
Daughter-Goddess, who in Rome had twinned with Bacchus under their
names of Liber and Libera.</p>
<p class="par">In the case of the far-famed cult of Osiris, again,
there gradually took place a similar transformation. In the oldest
Egyptian lore, Osiris is at once the brother and the husband of Isis,
who, when he is slain and dismembered by Typhon, gathers together the
scattered limbs for burial. Thereafter <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>their son, Horus (who in
turn had been found dead in his floating cradle and reborn by his
mother), avenges his father, who remains Judge of the Dead in the
underworld. But as the cult develops, Horus, who in one of his
aspects&mdash;perhaps originally signifying different deities&mdash;is
an adult and powerful God, becomes specially the child of Isis and
Osiris, and is typically represented as a suckling at his
mother&rsquo;s breast, or as the babe born like Jesus on the eve of the
winter solstice; while Osiris remains the suffering God, to be mourned
and rejoiced over; and it is to him that the devotee turns in the
mysteries for the mystic regeneration, which involved a worship of the
Osirian cross, the emblem of the God. &ldquo;I clasp the sycamore
tree,&rdquo; says the Osirified soul in the Book of the Dead; &ldquo;I
myself am joined unto the sycamore tree, and its arms are opened unto
me graciously.&rdquo; But Osiris in turn &ldquo;shall establish as
prince and ruler his son Horus&rdquo;; and the soul in the underworld,
in some rituals, becomes one with Horus, as in others with Osiris. Out
of the medley there emerged for the popular mind the dominant
impressions of Osiris as the Saviour and Judge of the Dead; of Isis as
the Queen of Heaven, the Sorrowing Goddess, the Mother-Goddess; and of
Horus as the Divine Son, Hor-pa-khrot, &ldquo;Horus the Child,&rdquo;
of whom the Greeks in their fanciful way made a Harpocrates, the God of
Silence, misunderstanding the symbol of the finger in the mouth, which
for the Egyptians meant merely childhood. As we have seen, the Osirian
cult and that of Serapis, grafted on it in the time of the Ptolemies,
made popular the symbol of the cross long before Christianity, and
prepared for the latter religion in many other ways.</p>
<p class="par">Perhaps its closest counterpart, however, was its most
tenacious rival, the worship of the Persian Sun-God Mithra, first
introduced into Rome in the time of Pompey, whose troops received it
from the Cilician pirates, the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the army of
Mithridates, whom he conquered and enlisted in the Roman service.
Mithra being the most august of all the Gods of war, his worship became
the special religion of the Roman army. Apart from its promise of
immortality, its fascination lay in its elaborate initiations,
baptisms, probations, sacraments, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>mysteries, which were
kept at a higher level of moral stringency than those of almost any of
the competing cults. The God was epicene or bisexual, having a male and
a female aspect; and there seems to have been no amorous element in his
myth at the Christian period. Unless it be decided that such rituals
had prevailed all over the East, the Christian eucharist must be held
to have been a direct imitation of that of Mithraism, which it so
closely resembled that the early Fathers declared the priority of the
rival sacrament to be due to diabolic agency. But the Christian rite,
as we have seen, had old Palestinian roots, going back to sheer human
sacrifice. The Mithraist ritual, indeed, appears to have been the
actual source of part of the Christist mystery-play, inasmuch as
Mithra, whose special epithet was &ldquo;the Rock,&rdquo; was
liturgically represented as dead, buried in a rock tomb, mourned over,
and raised again amid rejoicing. For the Mithraists also the sign of
the cross, made on the forehead, was the supreme symbol; and it was
mainly their cult which established the old usage of calling the
Sun-day, the first of the week, &ldquo;the day of the Lord,&rdquo;
Mithra as the Sun being the first of the seven planetary spirits on
whose names the week was based. In the third century, the chief place
of the cult in the empire was on the Vatican mount at Rome; and there
it was that Christian legend located the martyrdom of Peter, who, as we
have seen, was assimilated to Mithra both in name and in
attributes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1848src" href="#xd21e1848" name=
"xd21e1848src">5</a></p>
<p class="par">In a special degree the Osirian and Dionysian and
Mithraic cults seem to have insisted on the doctrine of immortality
correlatively with the doctrine of eternal punishment; and insofar as
Mithraism is to be known from the present form of the Zendavesta, which
is but a revised portion of the older Mazdean literature, it appealed
to the imagination on this side at least as winningly as did the
Jesuist literature in respect, for instance, of the Apocalypse. Mithra
was the God of the upper and the nether world, the keeper of the keys
of heaven and hell, of life and death; and, like Osiris, he was the
judge of men&rsquo;s deeds. Like the other Saviour-cults, too,
Mithraism <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>anticipated Christism in evolving the attraction
of a Mother-Goddess, the worship of Cybel&ecirc; being adapted to his
as it had been to that of Attis. In one other aspect it seems to have
run closely parallel to early Jesuism. The singular phrase in the
Apocalypse about garments &ldquo;washed in the blood of the Lamb&rdquo;
points to an early Jesuist use of the practice of the
<i>kriobolium</i>, which with the <i>taurobolium</i> was one of the
most striking of the Mithraic rites. In these repulsive ceremonies the
ram or bull&mdash;always young, on the principle that the sacrifice
must be pure&mdash;was slain over a grating, so that the blood dripped
on the initiate, who was placed in a pit beneath, and who was
instructed to wear the blood-stained garment for some days. It was
believed that the ceremony had a supreme saving grace; and the initiate
was solemnly described as <i lang="la">in &aelig;ternum renatus</i>,
&ldquo;born again for eternity.&rdquo; In regard to both animals the
symbolism was partly astronomical, having latterly reference to the
sun&rsquo;s entrance into the constellations of the Bull and the Ram at
different stages of his course. Mithra&rsquo;s oldest and best-known
symbol was the bull; but inasmuch as the sun had anciently been seen by
the Chaldean astronomers to be in the constellation Aries at the spring
season, the beginning of the ancient year, the lamb had long been
likewise adopted into the mysteries of the solar cults. About the
beginning of the Christian era the year-opening constellation was
Pisces; and the Divine Fish accordingly figures to a great extent in
early Christian symbols.</p>
<p class="par">As we have seen, the primordial Jesuism, with its Lamb
&ldquo;slain from the founding of the world,&rdquo; probably conceived
of its deity in terms of the astronomical symbol; but the prominence
given by Mithraism to the blood-ritual would serve to bring that into
disuse among the Gentile Christists, whose creed further made Jesus the
final paschal sacrifice, and reduced the apocalyptic phrase to a moral
metaphor. Nonetheless, the rites and theories of the great pagan cults,
all of which flourished in Palestine itself in the pre-Roman period,
must be recognized as factors in its creation.</p>
<p class="par">How completely Christianity belongs to the world of
religious ideas in which it arose may be realised, finally, by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>a glance at the worship of the Roman Emperor,
already established before the Christian era. In Virgil&rsquo;s Fourth
Eclogue, written about 40 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, there is sung
for Romans the universal myth of the coming Child, who is to be Saviour
and Lord of a rejuvenated earth, and whom Virgil was ready to identify
with the nephew of Augustus. But in the same period he sings of
Augustus as already divine; and Augustus in due course exploited for
himself the whole idea. Not only did he, like Alexander, set in
currency the typical fable of his mother&rsquo;s intercourse with
Apollo, and a Roman version of the ancient myth which in the gospels
becomes the story of the Massacre of the Innocents: in edicts which are
in part actually preserved on monuments he gave himself out in the East
as a God and Saviour whose birthday was henceforth to be celebrated as
the beginning of an evangel to the world, and who was to make an end of
war and disorder. Later emperors continued the expedient, which had
been well tried by Persian and Egyptian kings in previous ages.</p>
<p class="par">Against such divine pretensions on the part of the Roman
conqueror the Jews would instinctively develop their own formulated
hope of a Jewish Messiah; and wherever in the Empire men revolted
against the apotheosis of the earthly autocrat, the Jud&aelig;o-Gentile
cult of the slain and re-arising Christ, who was soon to come and judge
the world, would find devotees eager to accord to him the attributes
claimed by C&aelig;sar, and whatever others might avail. The new
religion was thus in every aspect a syncretism of the religious
material of the time.</p>

Popular and Philosophic</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It lies on the face of the case that the Christist
cult could make no rapid headway by offering to people of any class
higher ethical ideals than they had already been wont to recognize. To
claim that it did is to upset the concurrent theorem that the pagan
world into which Christianity entered was profoundly corrupt. If men
and women on all hands welcomed the new teaching for its moral beauty,
they must already have acquired a taste for such beauty, and cannot
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>conceivably have been &ldquo;sunk in trespasses
and sins.&rdquo; It is true that in every unlettered
population&mdash;in modern India and pre-Christian Mexico as well as in
classic antiquity&mdash;a repute for asceticism has brought great
popular honour, men reverencing a self-denial they feel unable to
practise. But a cult and a community which actually seek to embrace the
common people cannot exact from them a &ldquo;saintliness&rdquo; which
in the terms of the case is a rare phenomenon. In reality the Christian
ethic was duplicated at every point by that of Judaism or of one or
other of the pagan schools or cults; and the contrast still commonly
drawn between the church and its moral environment is framed by merely
comparing Christian theory with popular pagan practice. Theory for
theory, and practice for practice, there was no such difference.</p>
<p class="par">If the ethical literature of the period be first taken,
it is found that the teaching of (for instance) Seneca had so many
points of identity with that of Paul as to give colour to a Christian
theory that the pagan moralist and the apostle had had intercourse. It
is now admitted that no such intercourse took place, and that the
pretended letters of Paul and Seneca are Christian forgeries. But the
community of doctrine is undisputed. It was largely traceable to
elements of oriental ethic which had been imported into Greek Stoicism
by writers of Semitic race; and on Seneca&rsquo;s side the moral
principles involved are at some points much further developed than they
can be said to be in either the gospels or the epistles. In some
respects he is concrete and practical where the gospels are vague and
abstract, as when he condemns all war and urges habits of kindly
fellowship between masters and slaves. On the latter head, Philo of
Alexandria, the Jewish Platonist, went still further, explicitly
condemning slavery as the worst of evils and denying Aristotle&rsquo;s
dictum that for some men it is the natural state. Such doctrines as
those of reciprocity and the forgiveness of injuries were of course the
common property of the moralists of all civilized countries before the
Christian era&mdash;of the teachers of China and India as well as of
Greece; and the duty of practical beneficence, which in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>section
of the gentilizing third gospel is made the whole question of moral and
religious life, was indicated in almost exactly the same terms in the
much more ancient sacred books of Egypt.</p>
<p class="par">Where the Christist ethic differed most from that of the
higher paganism was on the point of sacrificial substitution or
&ldquo;salvation by blood,&rdquo; and on the point of moral
self-humiliation. Stoicism on the contrary cultivated self-respect,
here carrying on a strain of thought found in rabbinical Judaism; and
it is at least an open question whether &ldquo;voluntary
humility&rdquo; (which in the later epistles is disparaged) proved in
practice the more efficient moral principle. In such a writer as
Juvenal we find a protest against the habit of praying to the Gods for
all manner of boons, the argument being that the Gods know better than
their worshippers what the latter really need. In the gospel, similar
teaching precedes the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer; and whereas in both cases
the principle laid down is deviated from, the pagan, who prays for a
sound mind in a sound body, is in no worse case than the Christist, who
proceeds to pray for daily bread&mdash;if, that is, the ordinary
rendering be accepted. If, as seems probable, the intention was to pray
for &ldquo;spiritual food,&rdquo; the contrast is again between a
cultivation of self-reliance and a cultivation of the sense of
spiritual dependence. Yet at bottom, inasmuch as the sense of divine
support would theoretically give confidence, the practical outcome was
probably the same, for good or for evil. When, however, to the doctrine
of salvation by faith the Pauline theology added the principle that God
was the potter and man the clay, without moral rights, there was set up
a conception of morals which could not but be demoralizing, and to
which there was no parallel in the higher pagan teaching.</p>
<p class="par">As regards the Christist doctrine of sacrificial
salvation, it is found that both under Judaism and under paganism
higher moral standards had been reached by many thinkers; and
Christism, as we have seen, was rather an adhesion to the popular
religious ethic, which on this side was of an immemorial antiquity. So,
too, many of the greater pagan and Jewish thinkers, while holding to
the belief in immortality, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href=
"#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>had long before transcended the
doctrine of future rewards and punishments, and had repelled the
conception of a God of wrath; whereas the Christists stressed the
conceptions prevalent among average Jews and Gentiles, taking over
bodily, in particular, the popular idea of hell-torments, which was as
vivid, and as inefficacious, in the ancient world as in the medieval.
Worse still, the new faith ultimately introduced the frightful dogma of
the damnation of all unbaptized infants, a teaching before undreamt of,
and capable only of searing the heart. For the rest, the formal ethic
was very much the same in all cults as to the duties of honesty,
truthfulness, charity, and chastity; and the practice in all seems to
have been alike precarious. Not any more than any of the contemporary
religions did Christism offer any such social or political guidance as
might conceivably have arrested the political paralysis and decadence
of the whole imperial world. On the contrary, the gospels and epistles
alike predict a speedy doomsday, and counsel political submission,
showing no trace of any other ideal; while at the end of the second
century such a teacher as Origen is found coupling the principle of the
universal Roman dominion with that of the universal church. To any
surviving vestiges of the ideal of self-government, Christian
literature was broadly hostile. Inasmuch, too, as the gospel explicitly
urged celibacy as a condition of ready salvation (Lk. xx, 35; cp. Mt.
xix, 12), it tended to hold at arm&rsquo;s length the mass of normal
people and to attract the fanatics and the pretenders to sanctity. In
all likelihood, however, such doctrines were stressed only by the more
ascetic teachers and sects; the Pauline letters, for instance, finally
holding a middle course.</p>
<p class="par">Insofar, finally, as the principle of brotherly love is
traditionally held to distinguish Christist teaching and practice from
that of either Jews or pagans, there has occurred a fallacy of
inference. All the documents go to show that the inculcation and
profession of mutual love came currently from mouths which passed with
no sense of incongruity to denunciation. In Christian tradition, the
John who figured as the preacher of love was without misgiving called a
&ldquo;son of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>thunder,&rdquo; and reputed to have shown intense
malice towards a heretic; and all the early teachers in turn, from Paul
to Tertullian, are found alternating between praise of love and display
of its contrary, even as Jesus is made by the gospel-framers to
vituperate the contemporaries whom he was supposed to have exhorted to
love their enemies. Even the duty of forgiveness is in one passage
enforced by the threat of future torture at the hands of a Heavenly
Father who is thus to imitate the cruelties of human law; whereas
rationalistic thinkers among the Greeks a century or two before had
grounded the duty on the naturalness of error, urging that wrongdoers
should be taught rather than hated. So far were the Christists at any
period from attaining the height of feeling kindly towards those
outside their creed, that they exhibited an exceptional measure of
strife among themselves&mdash;this by mere reason of the openings for
strife set up by their dogmatic system and the need of unifying it. In
times of persecution, doubtless, they were thrown together in feeling,
as any other community would be; but here, in the terms of the case, it
was the persecution, not the creed, that created the fraternity. Nor
can it be said that any contemporary Christian teachers, unless it
might be some of the ostracized Gnostics, compare well in point of
serenity and self-control with such pagans as the later Stoics. For the
rest, the human material indicated in the Pauline accounts of the
congregational habit of <i>glossolalia</i>, &ldquo;speaking with
tongues&rdquo; (a mere hysterical outcry, of which the sounds had no
meaning), is clearly neurotic, and must have been liable to all manner
of lapses.</p>
<p class="par">To say this is but to say that actual Christianity at
length became popular in the only possible way&mdash;by assimilating
ordinary human nature in mass. Had it persistently transcended or
coerced average character, it could never have become one of the
world-religions. To say, again, that the written doctrine at its best
prescribed higher standards than those actually followed by its
adherents, is but to claim what can equally be claimed for many other
systems, popular and philosophic. The fundamental source of error in
this connection is the assumption that mere moral doctrine can
regenerate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>any society independently of a vital change in
social and intellectual conditions. In the ancient world, as in the
modern, these were the substantial determinants for the mass of men and
women.</p>
<p class="par">Even as regards the moral ideal itself, finally, it is
important to realize that what passes for the high-water mark of
Christian ethic is really pre-Christian doctrine. It is customary to
name the so-called Sermon on the Mount as the fine flower of gospel
teaching; and of that document the precept of love to enemies is felt
to be the finest word. Without asking how often it has been obeyed,
Christians are wont to regard it as marking the difference in moral
ideal between their lore and that of Jew and pagan. In point of fact,
the noblest parable for its illustration is furnished by the pagan tale
of Lycurgus and the young aristocrat who destroyed his eye; and the
precept in the gospel is demonstrably Jewish. Not only is it, like the
rest of the &ldquo;Sermon&rdquo; in general, fully paralleled in Old
Testament and other pre-Christian Hebrew literature<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1915src" href="#xd21e1915" name="xd21e1915src">6</a>: the
gospel sentences are immediately adapted from the <i>Teaching of the
Twelve Apostles</i>, of which the priority is here self-evident. The
text there runs: &ldquo;Bless them that curse you, and pray for your
enemies, and fast for them that persecute you; for what thank (have ye)
if ye love them that love you? Do not the foreigners [<i>ta
ethn&#275;</i>, &ldquo;the gentiles&rdquo;] do the same? But love ye
them that hate you, and ye shall have no enemy.&rdquo; In the gospel
(Mt. v, 44&ndash;47; rev. text) we have: &ldquo;Do not even <i>the
tax-gatherers</i> the same?&rdquo; and again: &ldquo;Do not even the
foreigners (<i>ethnikoi</i>) the same?&rdquo; The old <i lang=
"la">textus receptus</i>, now curtailed, has actually been amplified in
imitation of the <i>Teaching</i>; but the substitution of
&ldquo;tax-gatherers&rdquo; (<i>telonai</i>) for &ldquo;gentiles&rdquo;
tells of an earlier modification. In the <i>Teaching</i>, a primarily
Jewish document, the gentiles, &ldquo;the strangers,&rdquo; are quite
simply indicated as religiously alien in mass to the Jew: for the
gentilizing Christists the moral had to be pointed as between the
faithful and a class proscribed throughout the empire. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It was doubtless a deep spiritual experience that led
any sons of Israel, in an age of defeat and iron oppression, to realize
the vanity of hate, and the one way to cast off its burden. But not
only had the lesson been learned in the days &ldquo;before
Christ&rdquo;: it had actually been embodied in the manual carried by
the Twelve Apostles of the High Priest or the Patriarch for the
teaching of the Jews scattered throughout the Roman empire. &ldquo;If
anyone ask from thee what is thine,&rdquo; says the manual simply,
&ldquo;ask it not back, for indeed <i>thou canst not</i>&rdquo;&mdash;a
precept to the expatriated Jew to bear with meekness the wrongs for
which there was no legal remedy. As little as the Christian, perhaps,
did the Jew assimilate the doctrine of forgiveness; but at least let it
be noted that the doctrine had been framed by his race. <span class=

Appeal</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Overshadowed among the Jews by the common
traditions of Judaism, and faced among the Gentiles by such competition
as we have seen, the Christian cult had to acquire all the chief
attractions of popular pagan religion if it was to outdo its rivals.
Such success could never have been reached through mere superiority of
ethical ideal, even had such superiority been present: by the admission
even of Christian advocates, there were high moral ideals in most of
the pagan ethical systems current among the educated class; but those
systems never became popular, not seeking to be so. To gain the mass,
the new propagandists found, the tastes of the mass had to be
propitiated; and at best the more conscientious of them could but hope
to control the ignorance and the superstition they sought to attract.
When in the second and third centuries the more rigid Puritans, such as
the Montanists, formed themselves into special communities, they were
inevitably repudiated by the main body, which had to temper its
doctrine to the characters of the average laity and the average clergy.
Thus the development of primitive Christianity was necessarily such an
assimilation of neighbouring lore and practice as we have already in
part traced. The story of the Christ had to take on all the lasting
dramatic features of the prehistoric worships; and the mysteries had as
far as possible to embody those details in the dramatic pagan fashion.
Where dramatization was going on, new details would naturally be added,
all tending to the same end; and on the basis of these early dramatic
inventions would arise many of the gospel narratives. This, however,
must have been a matter of time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"
href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In the earlier stages of propaganda the appeal was
primarily to Jews, and secondarily to Jew proselytes; but after the
destruction of the temple of Jerusalem it must have been made in an
increasing degree to Gentiles, chiefly of the poorer classes, whether
artisans or traders. As among the pagan religious societies before
mentioned, slaves were admitted; such being not seldom in as good a
position as artisans. There is also evidence that, on the avowed
theological principles of the sect, men even of bad repute were
received, of course on condition of repentance. &ldquo;Let him that
stole, steal no more,&rdquo; is one of the injunctions in one of the
later epistles. In the nature of the case such adherents could not be
multiplied, in the teeth of the attractions of the other cults, without
a continual offer of congenial entertainment; and the weekly
&ldquo;love-feast,&rdquo; on the &ldquo;day of the Lord,&rdquo; would
be the first mainstay. The constant warnings and admonitions in the
epistles exclude the notion that these assemblies escaped the usual
risks of disorder; and the standing problem of the supervisors was to
maintain the social attraction without tolerating open licence. Insofar
as they succeeded, for a time, it was by appeal to ideals of abstinence
which, as we have seen, had long been current in the East.</p>
<p class="par">In the main, the popular success of the movement must
have depended on a compromise. When &ldquo;freedom from the yoke of the
law&rdquo; went so far as to set up a serious scandal among the pagans
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%205">1 Cor.
v</a>) it was necessarily suppressed; but from the first there
evidently occurred such irregularities as were later charged by
Tertullian against his fellow-Christians in the matter of their
nocturnal assemblies. Only out of average material could a popular
movement be made, and the more the cult spread the more was it
compelled to assimilate the usages of paganism, giving them whatever
new colour or pretext seemed best. But to the successful manipulation
of such a movement there was necessary a body of propagandists, a
written doctrine, and a machinery of organization; and it was chiefly
by the development of such machinery that the Christist movement
secured itself in the struggle for survival. In this regard its success
as against Mithraism <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69"
name="pb69">69</a>]</span>becomes perfectly intelligible. The priests
of Mithra seem never to have aimed at popular acceptance save insofar
as their cult became co-extensive with the Roman army; their ideal
being rather that of a religious freemasonry than that of an open
community. The Christists, on the other hand, seem to have carried on
from the first the Jewish impulses of fanaticism and proselytism,
aiming at popularity with the acquired Jewish knowledge of the
financial possibilities of any numerous movement.</p>

Causation</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The play of economic interest in the establishment
and maintenance of religions is one of the constant forces in their
history. In the simplest forms of savage life the medicine-man or
priest makes a superior living out of his function; and every powerful
cult in antiquity enriched its priests. The developed worships of
Assyria and Babylon, Ph&oelig;nicia and Egypt, were carried on by great
priestly corporations, with enormous revenues; those of the Egyptian
priesthood in particular being reckoned even in the Roman period at a
third of the wealth of the nation. Early Greece and Rome, in
comparison, showed little ecclesiastical development by reason mainly
of the fact that their relative political freedom offered so many other
channels to acquisitive energy. In republican Rome priesthood was a
caste-privilege enjoyed by a select few, the majority of the ruling
class being content to have it so; and there and in Greece alike the
normal conception of deities as local, with local worships, precluded
even the thought of a universal priesthood, though the Roman policy
gave all the Gods of the extending State a place in the common
pantheon. In old Greece it came about that the fixed ideal of the
City-State, and the very multiplicity of cults even in the separate
states, kept all the worships isolated; while the republican habit kept
the priests and priestesses members of the body politic, and not
associations apart. The Christian church began its historic growth on
this ground, in the period of imperialism and decadence, with the
eastern examples before it, the Jewish system of church-finance and
propaganda to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>proceed upon, the Greek democratic practice to
facilitate its first steps, and the Roman sway to allow of its spread
and official organization. Lastly came the usage, imitated from the
later political and religious life of the Greeks, of Church Synods, in
which disruptive doctrinal tendencies were more or less controlled by
the principle of the majority vote, and the weaker groups were assisted
and encouraged by the others. In every aspect the evolution was by way
of adaptation on tried lines.</p>
<p class="par">As we have seen, Judaism in the Hellenistic and Roman
period was financed through a system of travelling
&ldquo;apostles&rdquo; and collectors, who followed up the dispersed
Jewish race wherever it flourished, and got together great revenues for
the temple service and the priestly and rabbinical class. Jesuism began
on those lines, and so set up habits of intercommunication between its
groups, which for their own part were locally and independently
financed by their members in the Greek and Jewish fashion. Whatever may
have been the practice of enthusiasts such as Paul would appear to have
been, the principle that &ldquo;the labourer is worthy of his
hire&rdquo; must have become general; and insofar as special preaching
was a requisite and an attraction for the members, the travelling
preachers would have to be fee&rsquo;d or salaried. One of the later
epistles makes mention of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and
teachers, as different types; also of elders (presbyters), deacons, and
bishops (overseers); and as the groups increased and began to possess
buildings, the creation of professional opportunities set up a new
economic interest in propaganda.</p>
<p class="par">In neither Greek nor Roman life was the phenomenon new.
Centuries before the Christian era, the influx of the Dionysian and
other mystic cults in Greece had been followed by the rise of swarms of
religious mendicants, many of whom carried with them sacred books and
ministered consolation while playing on credulity; and on a higher
plane the educated &ldquo;sophists&rdquo; or humanists of the
pre-Macedonian period had made a livelihood by moral and philosophical
teaching or lecturing. Later, the Stoics and other philosophers became
a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>species of religious directors or &ldquo;spiritual
advisers&rdquo; as well as ethical lecturers; and in Rome especially
this calling had practically the status of a profession. Thus had
arisen a specific means of livelihood for educated men without official
posts or inherited incomes. But any religious cult which should set up
an organization would have as against such teachers an obvious
financial advantage, in respect of its power of attracting numbers, its
local permanence, and its means of collecting revenue; and even men
incapable of success as lecturers could attain relatively secure
positions as presbyters or &ldquo;bishops&rdquo;&mdash;that is,
overseers, first of single churches, and later of district groups. The
original function of the bishop was that later assigned to
&ldquo;elders&rdquo; in the presbyterian system&mdash;the supervision
of the public offerings or &ldquo;collections&rdquo; and their
distribution among needy brethren. Later, the bishop became the
religious head of the group, and its representative in communication
with others. Not till such organization was reached could the new sect
count on permanence.</p>
<p class="par">An important source of income from an early stage was
the munificence of the richer women converts; and insofar as the
Christist movement stood for a restraint on sexual licence it doubtless
gained from the moral bias as well as from the superstition of women of
the upper and middle classes throughout the empire. The richer women
were indeed made to feel that it was their duty to make
&ldquo;oblations&rdquo; in proportion to their means. On the other
hand, then as now, the giving of alms to the poor was a means of
enlisting the sympathetic support of serious women; and the Christists
here had a lead not only from oriental example in general and that of
later Judaism in particular, but from the policy of food-doles now
systematically pursued in the Roman empire. The later epistles show
that much was made of the good offices of &ldquo;widows,&rdquo; who,
themselves poor and wholly or partly supported by the congregations,
would serve as comforters of suffering or bereaved members, and
ministrants to the sick. The death-rate was doubtless high in the
eastern cities, then as now. In this way were attracted to the church
large masses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>of the outside poor who were not similarly
considered or sought for by any of the competing pagan cults. But it
was necessary to compete in other ways with the mass of itinerant
diviners and religious mendicants, who had much the same kind of vogue
as the begging friars of later Christendom; and exorcists were at an
early date a recognized class of officers in connection with the
Christian churches.</p>
<p class="par">At what stage revenue began to be derived from the usage
of praying for the souls of the dead it is impossible to say; but as
early as the third century it is found to be customary to recite before
the altar the names of givers of oblations, who were then publicly
prayed for. In various other ways the church was able to elicit gifts.
It lies on the face of all the canonical books that a prediction of the
speedy end of the world was one of the constant doctrines of the early
church; and such a belief would naturally elicit donations in the first
century as it did in the tenth. Obviously, too, the gradual development
of the &ldquo;mysteries&rdquo; would strengthen the hands of the
priestly class. In particular, as it was early made compulsory on all
baptized persons, except penitents, to take the sacrament, the
privilege of administering or withholding the eucharist was a sure
source of revenue, as was the power of initiation into the mysteries of
the other cults for their ministrants.</p>

and Sacred Books</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was finally to the joined influences of
ecclesiastical organization and of popular sacred books that Christism
owed its measure of success as against the freely-competing pagan
cults; and on both sides its primary advantage, as we have seen, came
from its Judaic basis. For nearly two centuries the Hebrew Bible, made
widely accessible in the Septuagint version, was its literary mainstay,
by reason of the prestige attaching to such a mass of ancient religious
literature in the Greco-Roman world; and whereas other cults also had
their special lore, the Christist movement was specially buttressed by
its system of ecclesiastical union, also imitated from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>Judaic.
The ecclesiastical system, above all, was a means to the development of
the new sacred books which completed the definition of Christianity as
something apart from Judaism; and these in turn made a permanent
foundation for the historic church. A glance at the cult associated
with the name of the pagan Apollonius of Tyana, who won fame in the
first century, makes it clear that even where a great renown attached
to a travelling religious reformer and reputed wonder-worker, and where
an adoring biography served in some degree to prolong his fame, the
lack of a hierarchy or connected series of religious groups prevented
on the one hand its continuance, and on the other hand the necessary
development of the literature which should conserve it.</p>
<p class="par">The first traceable literature special to the
Christians, as we have seen, consisted in &ldquo;apostolic&rdquo; and
sub-apostolic epistles of exhortation, which were read aloud in the
churches after the Jewish manner. Priestly needs conserved such
documents, and further evoked forgeries, aimed against new heresies and
schisms. But the mass of men are always more easily to be attracted by
narrative than by homilies; and the mystery-play, by means of which
alone could the church at the outset compete with the pagan cults
similarly provided, lent itself to a written as well as to an acted
history.</p>
<p class="par">Such a document as the gospel story of the Supper and
its sequel is in itself the proof of the priority of the mystery-play,
in some simple form, to the gospel story. In its present degree of
detail the play must belong to a stage of the movement at which it had
made some Gentile headway; and its reduction to writing for reading may
be supposed to have taken place either at a time when the Christians by
reason of persecution were prevented from carrying on their usual
rituals or festivals, or, more probably, when the hierarchy decided for
prudential or disciplinary reasons to abandon the regular resort to
dramatic spectacle. It does not follow, of course, that none of the
didactic parts of the gospel was in writing before the play was
transcribed; but the fact that none of the Pauline epistles quotes any
of the Jesuine teachings, and that the first Clementine epistle alludes
to but one or two, is a reason for holding that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>they
came very slowly into existence. The dramatic development would
naturally occur for the most part or wholly in Gentile hands. It is not
certain, indeed, that the later Jews remained uniformly averse to
drama, which was partly forced on them by the Herods; and the theory of
a dramatic origin for the Apocalypse is not quite untenable; but it
happens that the most obviously dramatic parts of the gospel story are
those which, on Gentile lines, throw the guilt of the crucifixion on
the Jews.</p>
<p class="par">When once a gospel existed, interpolation and alteration
were for some generations easy; and what happened was a multiplication
of doctrines and documents at the hands of different groups or sects or
leaders, the men with dogmatic or moral ideas taking this means to
establish them, without regard to the coherence or consistency of the
texts. Many passages are visibly inserted in order to countervail
others, it being easier to add than to suppress. Only late in the
second century can a canon have begun to be formed, as the Clementine
epistles quote a now lost document in the nature of a gospel, and
Justin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Memoirs of the Apostles&rdquo; diverge from those
preserved. The later rejection by the Church of such documents proves
them to have been regarded as in part heretical; and parts of the
canonical gospels were altered for various dogmatic reasons after they
had been made to include much of the matter in the uncanonical. The
third gospel avows that &ldquo;many&rdquo; previous narratives existed;
and apart from all these there have been preserved a number of rejected
gospels, which run mainly to miraculous stories. Some of these were
long abundantly popular, that of &ldquo;Nicodemus&rdquo; having had
common vogue down to the Middle Ages. But the more thoughtful clergy
would soon recognize the greater value of documents which by their
teaching could impress the more educated of the laity; and the double
influence of the supernaturalism and the moral appeal went to create
cohesion throughout the movement.</p>
<p class="par">The organization, in turn, operated as a check on the
spread of heresies, which, after carrying it further afield, soon
threatened to dissolve the cult into an infinity of mutually repellent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>groups. Insofar, indeed, as these appealed to the
more speculative and quasi-philosophic minds, they were foredoomed to
decay with the decay of culture, and to be at best the creed of the
few. Those, in particular, who carried anti-Semitism to the point of
discrediting the Jewish Deity, lost the support of the Jewish sacred
books, of which the mere literary mass and variety constituted in such
an age a solid basis for a cultus. Yet even on those lines the
Manich&aelig;an cult spread far and lived long, so easy was it then for
any cult to rise. Survival lay with simple concrete myth of the popular
sort, concrete ritual, and explicit dogma backed by the force of the
State; and the needs of popular faith kept ever to the front the human
aspect of the crucified God, even when he was being dogmatically
declared to be at once distinct from and one with his co-eternal
Father. This indeed was but one of the many irreducible contradictions
imbedded in the sacred books. To bring these to consistency was
impossible; but the hierarchy could set up formal creeds over and above
them; and it mattered little to the official and financial continuity
of the Church that these creeds were themselves chronically altered.
What was necessary to success was simply some common standard and
common action.</p>

and Fixation</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is not to be supposed that any abnormal
sagacity presided over the formation of either the creed and canon or
the official system of the Church; but insofar as it survived it can be
seen to have done so in virtue alike of assimilation and of refusal to
assimilate. Much expansion was needed to make an area broad enough for
the pagan populace; and on the side of custom and myth hardly any pagan
element was ultimately refused. At the outset the great cause of strife
between Christian and pagan was the contemptuous refusal of the former
to show any respect for &ldquo;idols&rdquo;&mdash;a principle derived
by Jewry from Persia, and passed on to the first Jesuists. When,
however, the Christian cult became that of the State, it of necessity
reverted, as we shall see, to the psychology of the multitude, and
carried the use of images as far as pagans <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>had ever
done. Even the so-called &ldquo;animal-worship&rdquo; of the Egyptians
partly survived in such usages as the presence of the sacred ox and ass
in the mystery-play of the Nativity (an immemorial popular rite,
belonging to sun-worship), in the adoption of the &ldquo;four
<i>zoa</i>&rdquo; of the Apocalypse (old Oriental figures) as the
symbols of the four evangelists, and in the conception of &ldquo;the
Lamb.&rdquo; Before the period of image-worship, too, the Church had
fully accepted the compromise by which countless pagan
&ldquo;heroes&rdquo; and &ldquo;geniuses,&rdquo; the subjects of local
cults, became enrolled as saints and martyrs, whose bones had given to
tombs and wells and shrines a sacred virtue, and whose old
festival-days became part of the new ecclesiastical calendar.</p>
<p class="par">Above all, there was finally forced on the Church a cult
of the Mother as Virgin Goddess, without which it could not have held
its own against the great and well-managed worships of Isis and
Rhea-Cybel&ecirc; and D&ecirc;m&ecirc;t&ecirc;r; since the first and
last in particular aroused in multitudes a rapture of exalted devotion
such as was not psychologically possible towards even a crucified God,
save insofar as the emotion of women worshippers towards the slain
Demigod realized that of male devotees towards the Queen of Heaven and
the Mother and sustainer of things. If the original Jesus of the myth
had not had a mythical mother, it would have been necessary to invent
one. Once established, her elevation to the honours of Isis was
inevitable.</p>
<p class="par">No less necessary, on the other hand, to the official
survival of the new system was a dogmatic limit to new doctrine. Where
concrete myth and ritual enlarged the scope of the cult, freedom of
abstract speculation dissipated its forces and menaced its very
existence. All manner of streams might usefully flow into its current,
but when the main river threatened to break up into a hundred searching
rivulets there was a prospect of its being wholly lost in the sands.
This danger, sometimes charged solely upon the Gnostics, arose with the
very first spread of the cult: every Pauline epistle, early or late,
exhibited the scope it gave for schism and faction. Mere random
&ldquo;prophesying,&rdquo; which it was difficult to discountenance,
meant endless novelties of doctrine. At every <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>stage at
which we can trace it the early Church is divided, be it by Judaism
against Gentilism, faith against works, Paul against Apollos, or one
Jesus against another: the very nature of the forces which made
possible the propaganda involved their frequent clash; and multitudes
of converts were doubtless won and lost in the chances of sectarian
strife. When to the Jews and proselytes and illiterates of the earlier
movement there began to be added speculative Gentile Gnostics, for whom
Yahweh was but one of many rival tribal Gods, and Jesus one of many
competitive slain Saviours, there came with them a species of heresy
which bade fair to lull all schism in a euthanasia of universalism. The
theosophies of Egypt and the East were alike drawn upon in the name of
Christism, and there resulted endless webs of grandiose mysticism, in
which the problem of the Cosmos was verbally solved by schemes of
intermediary powers between deity and man, and endless periods of
transformation between the first and the last states of matter. In
these philosophies Jesus was explained away or allegorized just as were
the Gods of paganism, and the motive force of fanatical ill-will
against those deities on the score of their characters was lost in a
reconciling symbolism. Framed for brooding minds that could not rest in
the primitive solutions of the popular cults, such systems on the other
hand could never attach or hold the mass of the people; and as they
were yet produced on all hands, the Christian organization was soon
forced to define its dogma if it would keep any distinguishing faith.
Insofar as so-called Gnosticism lent itself obediently to the
embellishment of the canonical writings and the confutation of the
heathen&mdash;as in the works of Clement of Alexandria&mdash;it was
accepted without much demur; but all new or independent theory was
tabooed. Speculative minds were dangerous things in a church aiming at
practical success; and they were assiduously barred out.</p>
<p class="par">The conservative process, of which we shall trace the
history, was carried on partly by documentary forgeries, partly by more
honest polemic, partly by administrative action and the voting of
creeds. But in the nature of the case the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>forgeries, where
successful, were the most central and decisive forces; and we may still
see, in the schematic narratives of the Acts of the Apostles, in the
interpolations of the Apocalypse, in some of the readjustments of the
gospel text, and in the more obviously spurious Pauline epistles, how
faction and fanaticism were fought with intelligent fraud; and how a
troublesome popular delusion was guarded against by creating another
that lent itself to official ends. The &ldquo;true&rdquo; creed is just
the creed which was able to survive.</p>

enter into the sacred books of the new faith, notably in the doctrine
of the <i>Logos</i> or &ldquo;Word,&rdquo; which in the fourth gospel
virtually reshapes the entire Jesuist system. That gospel, rather than
the preaching of Paul, is the doctrinal foundation of Gentile
Christianity. In the synoptics the founder broadly figures as a Judaic
Messiah, who is shortly to come again, at the world&rsquo;s end, to
judge the quick and the dead; and only for a community convinced of the
speedy approach of doomsday could such a religion suffice. In the

ii</a>) is a caveat inserted. When the period loosely specified for the
catastrophe was clearly passed, and the Church had become an economic
institution like another, it must needs present a religion for a
permanent world if it was to hold its own; and while the changing
speculations of the Gnostics had to be vetoed in the interests of
solidarity, some scheme of philosophic dogma was needed which, like
theirs, should envisage the world as an enduring process. Pauline
polemic did but claim for believing Gentiles a part in the Jewish
salvation, and such a view had been reached by Philo before Paul. The
fourth gospel, substituting the Christ-sacrifice for the Jewish
Passover, and putting a world-Logos in place of a descendant of David,
gave the theoretic basis of a permanent cosmopolitan cult analogous to
those of Egypt and Persia. The invention of a gentilizing history of
the first apostles was a part of the same process of adaptation;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>but the fourth gospel supplied the religion for
the Church which the official adaptors sought to develop.</p>
<p class="par">Such an evolution was psychologically prepared for by
the whole drift of latter-day Jewish thought outside of Judea. The idea
of &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; of the deity as an entity, capable of
personification, had long belonged to Jewish theology in terms of many
passages in the Old Testament, and is but one variant of the
psychological process by which Brahmans came to conceive of the Vedas,
and Moslems of the Koran, as eternal existences. The Chaldaic word
<i>Memra</i> had already much of the mystic significance of
<i>Logos</i>, which meant both &ldquo;word&rdquo; and
&ldquo;reason&rdquo;; the books of Proverbs, Job, and the Wisdom of
Solomon had made familiar the conception of a personified divine
Wisdom, dwelling beside the deity; and the Alexandrian Jew Philo had
made the <i>Logos</i> a central figure in his theosophy. But in the
theosophies of Egypt and Persia the same conception had long been
established; Plato had made it current in the theosophy of the Greeks,
combining it with a mystic doctrine of the cross; and Thoth and Hermes
and Mithra were already known as the <i>Logos</i> to their worshippers.
Thus, whether the fourth gospel were framed at Ephesus or at
Alexandria, by a cosmopolitan Jew or by a Gentile proselyte, it had
grounds of appeal to every Christist save the original Judaic Jesuists,
whose monopoly it was framed to overthrow. It of course gave no
coherent philosophy of the universe, and merely evaded the problem of
evil, which the Gnostics were constantly seeking to solve; but it was
none the worse a religious document for that.</p>
<p class="par">Nonetheless, it needed the stress of circumstance to
force it into its fitting place in the new religion. Despite the many
passages inserted to bring its narrative into harmony with the other
gospels, the fourth differs so much more from them than they do from
each other that only the vital needs of the cult in its struggle for
existence can account for the final adoption of all four. But these
needs were compulsive, and overrode the opposition the fourth gospel
evoked. Such a mass of doctrine purporting to come from the very mouth
of the founder could not in any case be refused by such a community;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>and when once the treatise on such grounds had
been taken into the canon it played its part in paralyzing the faculty
of judgment. The fourth gospel directly excludes the pretence that the
God-man was born at Bethlehem; yet it was grouped, like the second,
which ignores the tale, with the first and third, which
circumstantially yet discordantly enounce it. Where irreconcilable
differences on the most essential matters of biographical fact could
thus be let pass, the widest divergence of doctrinal idea could find
acceptance. The two pressures of predisposition and corporate interest
availed to override the difficulties they had created; and the primary
momentum of ignorant credulity among the faithful carried all before
it. Easiness of belief correlated with proneness to invention, and the
religious community cohered, as others do, by force of the gregarious
bias, the hostile environment, and the economic interest. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When the &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; Christian Church
becomes politically and socially distinguishable in the second century,
it is a much less numerous body than is pretended in the literature of
its champions. Formulas such as those used in the Acts of the Apostles
(chs. ii, iv, v, vi) greatly falsify the state of the case. The first
&ldquo;churches&rdquo; in the cities of Asia Minor, like the groups
addressed by &ldquo;Paul&rdquo; in the epistles, were but small
conventicles, meeting in private houses. Even in the fourth century,
sixty years after Constantine&rsquo;s adoption of the faith, the church
of Antioch, one of the oldest and most important, appears to have
numbered only a fifth part of the population of the city, or about one
hundred thousand out of half-a-million. In the extensive diocese of
Neo-C&aelig;sarea, in the third century, there were declared to be only
seventeen believers; and in the church of Rome itself, in the same
century, there were probably not more than fifty thousand members all
told out of a population of perhaps a million. In Egypt again there was
no church outside Alexandria till about the end of the second century.
Thus the language of Justin and Tertullian and other Fathers, echoing
the Acts, to the effect that the Christians were everywhere throughout
the empire, and that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82"
name="pb82">82</a>]</span>the gospel had been preached and Jesus prayed
to in every nation, is mere rhetoric in the oriental taste. Only in the
towns of the empire&mdash;though often in small towns in the
East&mdash;did the church exist at all: the <i>pagani</i> or people of
the rural districts were so uniformly fixed in their beliefs that their
name became for Christians the generic term for the adherents of the
old faiths; and though there were some missionary movements in Persia
and Arabia, the western provinces were hardly at all reached by the
propaganda in the first two centuries. Even in Gaul there were few
adherents; while as regards Britain, where there is said to have been a
group at York in the third century, there is not to be found a single
monumental trace of the presence of Christianity during the four
centuries of the Roman occupation, though remains of the Mithraic cult,
which flourished in the army, are frequent. At the end of the second
century, then, probably not a hundredth part of the population even of
the central provinces of the Roman empire was Christianized, while the
outlying provinces were practically unaffected.</p>
<p class="par">Of the average inner life of the converts at this period
it is possible to form some idea by noting at once the current
doctrine, the claims of the apologists, the complaints of the apostolic
and later epistles, and the tenour and temper of the whole literature
of the Church. Something too may be inferred from the fact that the
early believers were mainly easterns even in Rome itself. Even on these
data, indeed, it would be a mistake to assume that any concrete
character type was predominant; but at several points we are entitled
to generalize as between the Christian movement and its antecedents and
surroundings. It was, for instance, very weakly developed on the
intellectual side, avowedly discouraging all use of reason, and
limiting the mental life to religious interests. Save for a certain
temperamental and moral energy in some of the Pauline epistles, there
is nothing in the propagandist literature of the early Church which
bears comparison with the best preceding literature of Greece and Rome.
The traditions concerning the apostles present men of a narrow and
fanatical vision and way of life, without outlook on human
possibilities, joyless save <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=
"#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>by way of religious exaltation,
painfully engrossed in theological contention and apocalyptic forecast.
The happiest teachers were perhaps the least intelligent. Papias,
bishop at Hierapolis, whom Eusebius later presents as having talked
with men who had heard the apostles, is pronounced by that historian to
have been of small understanding; and his ideas of the millennium, as
passed down, justify the criticism. Other traditional figures of the
second century, as the bishops Polycarp and Ignatius, are presented
mainly in their character of hortatory martyrs, the most advantageous
light in which ungifted men can be placed; and not a line ascribed to
them is above suspicion. Of the early Christians in general, indeed, a
transfiguring ideal has been shaped in terms of the aspect of martyrdom
and persecution&mdash;trials which, by forcing men and women back on
the central virtues of courage and constancy, positively ennoble
character. Such a compensating dignity of endurance is found where it
is apt to be least expected&mdash;in men and women long broken to
oriental tyranny; in Egyptian fellaheen, used to the lash; in peasants
wont mutely to toil and obey. But the possibility of such a correlation
does not alter the facts of normal life for the types in question.
Ignorance and fanaticism and superstition yield their normal fruits in
normal conditions. And there is Christian record that even among the
martyrs there were men of bad character, seeking a short way to
Paradise.</p>
<p class="par">Of the early Christian community many were slaves, and
perhaps from three to five per cent paupers. The proportion of women
was perhaps as large as it is in the churches of to-day; for it was one
of the pagan taunts that to women the preachers preferred above all to
address themselves, and rich women members seem to have been relatively
numerous. All orders alike believed fervently in evil spirits; and the
most constant aspect of their faith was as a protection against
demoniacal influence. In the service of the Church of Rome in the third
century there were forty-six presbyters, seven deacons, seven
sub-deacons, forty-two acolythes or clerks, and fifty
&ldquo;readers,&rdquo; <i>exorcists</i>, and janitors; and the
exorcists were at least as hard-worked as any other members of the
staff. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>On the side of morality, much stress was laid on
the sins of the flesh, partly because these were the commonest, partly
because the idea of an intellectual ethic had not arisen; and while the
Church was liable to gusts of persecution its practice was naturally
somewhat strict. Men and women who had joined the body mainly for its
alms or its <i>agap&aelig;</i> were not likely to adhere to it in times
of trouble; and the very proclamation of an ascetic standard would
primarily attract those persons, found in every community, who had a
vocation for asceticism. At almost any period, however, such were to be
found in the heretical or dissentient groups as well as in the main
body, while the testimony of the Pauline epistles is distinct as to the
antinomianism of many &ldquo;apostolic&rdquo; converts. Some Gnostic
sects were stringently ascetic if others were antinomian, the
<i>&agrave; priori</i> principle lending itself alternately to the
doctrines that the spirit must mortify the flesh, and that the deeds of
the flesh are nothing to the spirit. Within the main body, the
conflicting principles of faith and works, then as later, involved the
same divergences of practice. The evidence of Tertullian is emphatic as
to the illusoriness of much Christian profession in his day in the
churches of Carthage, where zeal was at least as abundant as
elsewhere.</p>
<p class="par">Taken individually, then, an average Christian of the
second century was likely to be an unlettered person of the
&ldquo;lower-middle&rdquo; or poorer classes; living in a town; either
bitterly averse to &ldquo;idols,&rdquo; theatres, the circus, and the
public baths, or persuaded that he ought to be; utterly credulous as to
demons and miracles; incapable of criticism as to sacred books;
neurotic or respectful towards neurosis; readily emotional towards the
crucified God and the sacred mystery in which were given the
&ldquo;body and blood&rdquo;; devoid alike of &aelig;sthetic and of
philosophic faculty; without the thought of civic duty or political
theory; much given to his ritual; capable of fanatical hatred and of
personal malice; but either constitutionally sober and chaste or
chronically anxious to be so, and in times of persecution exalted by
the passion of self-sacrifice; perhaps then transiently attaining to
the professed ideal of love towards enemies. But the effective bonds of
union for the community, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href=
"#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>whether in peace or during
persecution, were rather the ruling passion of hostility to pagan
beliefs and usages, and the eager hope of &ldquo;salvation,&rdquo; than
any enthusiasm of humanity, social or even sectarian. And, as an
orthodox ecclesiastic has remarked, we cannot &ldquo;even cursorily
read the New Testament without being astonished by the allusions so
often made to immoral persons calling themselves Christians.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Over such worshippers, in the first centuries, presided
a clergy of precarious culture, sometimes marked by force of character,
never by depth or breadth of thought. To compare the Christian writers
of the ancient world with the pagan thinkers who had preceded them by
three or more centuries is to have a vivid sense of the intellectual
decadence which had accompanied the growth of imperialism. From Plato
to Clement of Alexandria, from Aristotle to Tertullian, there is a
descent as from a great plateau to arid plains or airless valleys: the
disparity is as between different grades of organism. But even between
the early Christian fathers and the pagans near their own time the
intellectual and &aelig;sthetic contrast is flagrant. Justin Martyr and
Clement, put in comparison with either Plutarch or Epictetus, create at
once an impression of relative poverty of soul: the higher pagan life
is still the richer and the nobler; the Christian temper is more shrill
and acrid, even where, as in the case of Clement, it is nourished by
learning and pagan metaphysic. Even the cultured and relatively liberal
Origen, in his reply to Celsus, is often at a moral disadvantage as
against the pagan, who, especially when he passes from mere polemic on
Jewish lines to philosophic thought, is distinctly more masculine and
penetrating. So far from being less superstitious, the Christian
reverts to such vulgar beliefs as that in the magical virtue of certain
divine names. Yet Origen, who was born of educated Christian parents,
is almost the high-water mark of ancient Christian literature on the
side of culture and mental versatility (185&ndash;254).</p>
<p class="par">Up to the time of Clement and Origen, then, it may be
said, the Christian cult had won from paganism hardly one mind of any
signal competence; religious humanists such as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>Plutarch
and fine moralists such as Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus having gone to
their graves without being even transiently attracted by it. What
laughter was left in literature remained aloof from religion; Lucian
could have no place in the church, though it is probably his ridicule
of pagan deities that has won the preservation of his works at
Christian hands. It is only when the disease of empire has invaded all
the sources of the higher life, in the third and fourth centuries, that
the Christian writers, themselves representing no intellectual
recovery, begin to be comparable, mind for mind, with those of
contemporary paganism; and even then largeness of vision seems to
linger rather with the mystics of the older way of thought, as Porphyry
and Plotinus, than with the bitter polemists of the newer faith, as
Cyprian and Arnobius. The moral note which in the modern world is
supposed to be typically and primordially Christian, that of the
<i>Imitatio Christi</i>, is the one note never struck by the Christian
Fathers, or, if sounded, never sustained. It is rather a result of
medieval brooding, the outcome of many generations of cloister life and
of a settled ecclesiastical order, which walled-in an abnormal
peace.</p>
<p class="par">During those ages in which the Christian Church was so
spreading as to become at length the fit cultus of the decaying State,
its history is almost wholly one of internal and external strifes,
conflicts between the Church and its pagan persecutors, between its
literary champions and pagan criticism, between the champions of
orthodoxy and the innovating heretics, between the partisans of dogmas
whose life-and-death struggle was to determine what orthodoxy was to
be. The central sociological fact is the existence of an organization
with a durable economic life&mdash;durable because of ministering to an
enduring demand&mdash;in a society whose institutions were suffering
more and more from economic disease. Of this organization the component
parts united to resist and survive external hostility when that arose;
and for the command of its power and prestige, later, the conflicting
sections strove as against each other. In the history of both forms of
strife are involved at once that of its dogmas and that of its
hierarchic structure. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87"

Priesthood</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the Jesuist groups of the first century, as we
have seen, there were &ldquo;bishops&rdquo; or overseers, and other
&ldquo;presbyters&rdquo; or elders, so named in simple imitation of the
usages of other Greek-speaking religious societies, Jewish and Gentile,
in the eastern parts of the empire. The bishop was at first merely the
special supervisor and distributor of the &ldquo;collection,&rdquo;
whether of money or of other gifts, and was spiritually and socially on
the same level with the presbyters and deacons. None was specially
ordained, and ordinary members could at need even administer the
eucharist. Teaching or preaching was not at first a special function of
any member of a group, since any one could be a &ldquo;prophet&rdquo;
(unless indeed the &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; were so named later, after
the supervising priest or bishop in certain Egyptian temples, whose
function was to distribute revenue); but discourses were for a time
given by travelling apostles, who aimed at founding new groups, and who
ministered the eucharist wherever they went. It lay in the nature of
the case, however, that the function of the bishop should gain in moral
authority because of its economic importance; and that the informal
exhortations or &ldquo;prophesyings&rdquo; of the early days, which
were always apt to degenerate into the hysterical <i>glossolalia</i>,
or unintelligible &ldquo;tongues,&rdquo; should be superseded by the
regular preaching of ostensibly qualified men. In the first century
these must have been few, and they would usually be made the acting
bishops, who would gradually become more and more identified with the
administration of the &ldquo;mysteries,&rdquo; and would naturally
repel &ldquo;lay&rdquo; interference. Here again there was pagan
precedent, some of the pagan societies having a
&ldquo;theologos,&rdquo; while in all the &ldquo;bishop&rdquo; had a
certain precedence and authority.</p>
<p class="par">As congregations grew and services multiplied, however,
the bishop would need assistance, and to this end presbyters became
officially associated with him as con-celebrants. Only gradually,
however, did the sacerdotal spirit take full possession of the cult.
Liturgy was long a matter of local choice; and it is probable that the
complete mystery-play of the Agony and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>Crucifixion and
Resurrection was never performed save at a few large centres, in
competition with special pagan attractions of the same kind; but a
eucharist, with varying ritual and hymns, sung by special officials,
was the primary function of every church. As numbers and revenue
increased, men of an ambitious and administrative turn would inevitably
tend to enter the movement; and the second century was not out before
the avarice and arrogance of leading bishops were loudly complained of.
Nonetheless, their self-assertion promoted the growth of the sect. Such
men, in point of fact, tended to build up the Church as warlike nobles
later built up the fabric of feudalism, or self-seeking &ldquo;captains
of industry&rdquo; the special structure of modern commercial
societies. Righteousness and gentleness and spirituality could no more
create a popular and revenue-yielding Church in the Roman empire than
they can to-day create and maintain a &ldquo;paying&rdquo; industrial
organization. An early bishop, indeed, needed to recommend himself to
the congregation in order to get elected; but in a large town, with
personal magnetism and a staff of priests, he was certain to become a
determining force in church affairs. The aspiring priest looked forward
to a bishopric for himself; and in an illiterate congregation there
could be no effectual resistance to official assumptions which were
made with any tact. Thus were the scribes and Pharisees rapidly
duplicated.</p>
<p class="par">In an age of unbounded credulity the invitation to
deceit was constant; and, while credulity itself means the faculty for
innocent false witness, it could not be but that frauds were common in
matters of miracle-working of all kinds. To suppose that all the
miracle-stories arose in good faith when the deliberate manufacture of
false documents and calculated tamperings with the genuine were a main
part of the literary life of the Church, is to ignore all probability.
The systematic forgery and interpolation of &ldquo;Sibylline
Books&rdquo; by way of producing pagan testimonies and prophecies on
the side of Christism, is to be regarded as a clerical industry of the
second century. A bishop&rsquo;s business was to forward the fame and
interests of his Church; and in Ambrose&rsquo;s transparent account of
his discovery of miracle-working relics of saints at Milan in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>fourth century we have a typical instance of the
methods by which the prestige of the faith was advanced. Ambrose was
above and not below the moral average of previous bishops. To find what
might pass for the bones and relics of saints and martyrs, to frame
false tales concerning them, to win illiterate and poor pagans to the
Church by imitating their festivals and ceremonies&mdash;these were, by
the grieving admission of many Christian historians, among the common
activities of the Church from the second or third century onwards; and
the priesthood were the natural agents of the work. By the very fact,
however, that there were special reputations for wonder-working, as
that of Gregory Thaumaturgus in the third century, we are reminded that
the pretence was not universal. Imposture is a variation like another;
and there must always have been a proportion of normally honest minds,
however unintelligent and uncritical. It was their incapacity that
evoked fraud. Some, on the other hand, have recorded how the bones of
executed robbers were at times made to do duty as relics of
martyrs.</p>
<p class="par">On one side the character of the early as of the later
clergy of the &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; Church has suffered severely from
their own affirmation of a primitive theory of morals to which they
could not conform. In an age of lessening science and freedom, with
growing superstition, the barbarian ideal of asceticism gained ground
like other delusions. The idea that by physical self-mortification men
attain magical or intercessory power in spiritual things&mdash;an idea
found in all ancient religions, and enforced in numerous pagan
priesthoods&mdash;was imposed to some extent on Christism from the
first, and became more and more coercive as the cult passed out of
Jewish hands. The average presbyter of the second century, accordingly,
won his repute for sanctity in many cases by professing celibacy, which
in a large number of cases was too hard for him to maintain; and
between his own unhappy ideal and the demand of the crowd that he
should fulfil it, his life became in general a deception. In these
matters the multitude is always preposterously righteous. Aztecs in the
pre-Christian period, we know, were wont to put to death professed
ascetics <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>who lapsed; and the normal denunciation of
priestly immorality in Europe in the Middle Ages seems rarely to have
been checked by the thought that the priest&rsquo;s error consisted in
taking up a burden he could not bear. That priests ought to be celibate
the average priest-taught layman never doubted. Hence a premium on
hypocrisy in the period of church-creation. An artificial ethic created
an artificial crime, and Christian morality evolved demoralization. In
the second century began the practice of open priestly concubinage,
often on the na&iuml;ve pretence of a purely spiritual union. Denounced
periodically by bishops and councils for hundreds of years, it was
never even ostensibly checked in the period of the empire; and the
later discipline of the Western Church did but drive the symptom
beneath the surface to form a worse disorder.</p>
<p class="par">In the Roman period no machinery existed by which
celibacy could be enforced. Councils varied in their stringency on the
subject, and many bishops were capable of voting for a rule to which
they did not in private conform. As for the bishopric of Rome, it had
at that time only a ceremonial primacy over the other provinces. In the
second century Bishop Victor of Rome is recorded to have passed
sentence of excommunication on the easterns who would not conform to
his practice in the observation of Easter; but his authority was
defied, and his successors do not seem even to have asserted it in any
similar degree for centuries. In the third century Bishop Cyprian of
Carthage, the first zealous prelatist in the literature of the Church,
claimed merely primacy, without superior authority, for the chief
bishoprics, and for Rome over the rest. All bishops he held to be
spiritually equal&mdash;and indeed all presbyters, bishops included.
This held good theoretically as late as the fourth and fifth centuries,
with the exception that by that time the bishop alone had the right to
appoint to Church offices&mdash;originally the function of the whole
community. But alike the internal and the external conditions made for
the creation of a hierarchy. When in the third century the puritan
party in the Church at Rome sought to appoint Novatian as its separate
bishop, alongside of another, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>the bishops in the provinces, led by
Cyprian, zealously resisted, and secured the principle that no town
should have more than one bishop. In other ways the bishops necessarily
gathered power. To them had soon to be relegated the right of admitting
or refusing new members; and when there arose the question of the
treatment of those who lapsed in a time of persecution, there was no
way to secure uniformity of method save by leaving the matter to the
bishops, who in the main agreed on a rule. For such uniformity they
naturally strove in the days of danger; and the Church Synods, which
began in the second century and developed in the third, were tolerably
unanimous up to the time of the Establishment of the Church under
Constantine (313). It was when the Church as a whole had no longer
cause to fear the heathen that the worst strifes arose.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In New Testament Greek the same word has to stand
for &ldquo;sect&rdquo; and &ldquo;heresy,&rdquo; a fact premonitory of
what must happen to every new idea in religion. Any process of
reasoning whatever must have led to differences of opinion among the
converts of Paul or of the Pauline epistles; and such differences,
leading necessarily, among zealots, to animosities, are among the first
phenomena of Christism. As we have seen, the chief
&ldquo;heresies&rdquo; of the first century, stigmatized as such by the
later Church, were really independent cults older than itself; and
there is reason to think that the &ldquo;Nicolitaines&rdquo; execrated
in the Apocalypse were really the followers of Paul. At the beginning
of the second century, again, the first heretics on record are the
Elcesaites, who, however, as we saw, were obviously not an offshoot
from the Jesuists, but a separate body, their Christ being a gigantic
spirit and their doctrine a cluster of symbolisms. It is with the
so-called Gnostics, the claimants to a higher <i>Gnosis</i> or
knowledge, that heresy begins in Gentile Christianity; and as some of
these are already in evidence in the Pauline epistles, and had
interpolated the synoptics (Mt. xiii, Mk. iv, Lk. xii, 49, <i>sq.</i>),
to say nothing of framing the fourth gospel, they may fairly be
reckoned among &ldquo;the first Christians.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>Ere
long, however, they begin clearly to differentiate from the Christism
of the New Testament.</p>
<p class="par">If the early Gnostic systems be compared with that of
Paul, they will be found to have rather more in common with it than
with the Judaic Jesuism from which he ostensibly broke away. It is thus
not unlikely that their Christism, like his, is older than that of the
gospels, which is primarily of Jewish manufacture. The
&ldquo;Simonians&rdquo; of Samaria have every appearance of being
non-Jewish Christists &ldquo;before Christ&rdquo;; and the later
Gnostics have several Samaritan affinities. Like &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo;
they have no Jesuine biography; but whereas he ostensibly holds by an
actual man Jesus, however nondescript, they usually declare outright
for a mere divine phantom,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2194src" href=
"#xd21e2194" name="xd21e2194src">1</a> bearing a human semblance, but
uncontaminated by mixture with matter, which was the Gnostic symbol for
all evil. They did but attach the name of the Christos, and the hope of
salvation, to a general theosophy, as Paul attached it to Judaism; and
their great preoccupation was to account formally for the existence of
evil, which they commonly figured as either an evil power or an
essential quality of matter, forever opposed to the principle of good.
Hence the allusion to the &ldquo;oppositions of science falsely
so-called&rdquo;&mdash;that is, &ldquo;the antithesis of the
Gnosis&rdquo;&mdash;in the Pauline epistle. But they varied somewhat in
details according to their environment, being roughly divisible into
two groups&mdash;Asiatic and Egyptian.</p>
<p class="par">At the beginning of the second century those of Syria
are identified with the teaching of Saturninus of Antioch, in whose
theory a good God had made the seven angels, who in turn made the world
and created a low type of animal man in God&rsquo;s image, whom,
however, God compassionately endowed with a reasonable soul. Of the
seven angels one was left to rule the world, and figured as God of the
Jews; but the others competed with him; and Satan, the chief evil
power, made a race of men with an evil soul. Thereupon the Supreme God
sent his son as Jesus Christ, human only in seeming, to bring men to
the knowledge of the Father and defeat the rebel angels. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>Another
Syrian, Bardesanes, who lived in the reign of Marcus Aurelius, was less
anti-Jewish, and made the one God the creator of the world and of man,
who was at first ethereal and pure, but seduced and so degraded to the
form of flesh by the Adversary; the Christ&rsquo;s function being to
secure a higher future life to those who accept him. From both points
of view, mortification of the flesh was a primary duty&mdash;all the
carnal instincts being evil&mdash;and Jesus on the same ground was
denied bodily existence. Always the effort is to account for evil as
involved in matter, the work not of the Supreme God, but of a
subordinate power who will be vanquished. Thus Tatian, a pupil of
Justin Martyr and contemporary with Saturninus, makes the world-creator
a subordinate God, and seems to have derived Judaism and the gospel
similarly from inferior deities. Some, as Bardesanes and Tatian, held
by a bodily resurrection; others, as Saturninus and Cerdo (fl. 140),
stressed the anti-material principle and denied that the resurrection
could be in bodily form. On such an issue, of course, it was easy to
compromise in the concept of a &ldquo;spiritual body&rdquo; the same to
the eye as the real body, but impalpable to touch&mdash;in short, the
&ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of all ages.</p>
<p class="par">It is reasonable to infer that the Gnostic systems were
suggested by the spectacle of the earthly Governments around them, no
less than by the previous theologies. Even as the Autocrator reigned
without governing, and the evils of misgovernment were chargeable on
proconsuls, so, it was thought, the head of the universe, the
Pantocrator, could not be implicated in the evil wrought under him.
Such a conception seems to have first arisen in the great monarchies of
the East. It followed, however, that as some satraps and proconsuls
governed well, there might be good subordinate deities; and in the
system of Basilides the Egyptian, who belonged to the brilliant reign
of Hadrian, the attribute of goodness is graded endlessly, down to the
angels of the 365th heaven, who made this world and its inhabitants. As
in the system of Saturninus, God gives these a reasonable soul, but the
angels rebel, and their chief, who becomes God of the Jews, draws on
that nation the hatred of all others by his arrogance. Egyptian
Gnosticism <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>thus bore the stamp of the old Egyptian pantheism,
its every power emanating from the Unbegotten One; while the Asiatic
systems embody in some form the Mazdean principle of two opposed
powers, of which the worse is only ultimately to be defeated. Egyptian
precedent explains also the countless generations of the Gnostic
systems of Alexandria. As in Egyptian history dynasty followed on
dynasty, and as in the pantheon God was begotten of God, so in the
system of Basilides the Unbegotten produces from himself <i>Nous</i>,
Mind; which produces the <i>Logos</i>; which produces <i>Phronesis</i>,
Judgment; which produces <i>Sophia</i> and <i>Dynamis</i>, Wisdom and
Power; and these last in turn produce angels, who in turn reproduce
others down to the 365th grade. The system of Valentinus, assigned to
the period of Antoninus Pius, frames fresh complications, partly
suggestive of an immemorial bureaucracy which had duplicated itself in
the heavens, partly of an <i>&agrave; priori</i> psychology which
sought to explain the universe, now by first principles, after the
fashion of the early mythology of Rome, now by adaptations of the
current theosophy.</p>
<p class="par">In the hands of Valentinus religion becomes an imbroglio
which only an expert could master; and the functions of the Christ in
particular are a mere tangle of mystery. <i>Nous</i>, the first of many
&ldquo;&AElig;ons,&rdquo; is the &ldquo;only begotten&rdquo; Son, his
mother being <i>Ennoia</i>, Thought; yet with him is born Truth; and
these three with the Father make a first Tetrad. Then <i>Nous</i>
produces the <i>Logos</i> and Life; which beget Man and the Church;
which two pairs beget more &AElig;ons; and so on. In a later stage,
after a &ldquo;fall,&rdquo; <i>Nous</i> begets the Christos and the
Holy Spirit; while later still the &AElig;ons produce the &AElig;on
Jesus, Sophia and Horos playing a part in the evolution. Such a maze,
though it is said to have had many devotees, could not possibly be the
creed of a popular Church, even in Egypt; and wherever the gospels went
their ostensibly concrete Jesus held his own against such spectral
competition. The systems which made Jesus non-human and those which
made of him an elusive abstraction were alike disadvantaged as against
that which declared him to have been born of woman and to have suffered
the last agony for the sons of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95"
href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>men. Women could weep for the
crucified Man-God as they had immemorially done for Adonis and Osiris:
they could not shed tears for a phantasmagoric series of
Nous&mdash;Logos&mdash;Christ&mdash;&AElig;ons&mdash;Jesus, begetting
and begotten.</p>
<p class="par">Other Gnostics, still making mystical pretensions, were
content to represent Jesus as a superior human being born of Joseph and
Mary in the course of nature. Carpocrates of Alexandria, who so taught
in the reign of Hadrian, had a large following. Such tolerance of
&ldquo;materialism,&rdquo; however, brought on the sect charges of all
manner of sensuality; and there is categorical record that, following
Plato, they sought to practise community of women. Similarly, the
Basilidians were charged with regarding all bodily appetites as
indifferent, their founder having set his face against the
glorification of virginity, and taught that Jesus was not absolutely
sinless, since God could never permit an innocent being to be punished.
There is no proof, however, that any sect-founder was openly
antinomian; and while license doubtless occurred in many, we have the
evidence of the Pauline epistles that it could rise in the heart of the
primitive Church as easily as in any sect. In the same way, whatever
might be the doctrine of particular sections, it may be taken as
certain that the charge of bowing before persecution, cast at some,
held partly true of nearly all.</p>
<p class="par">Systems such as the bulk of those above described,
drawing as they did on any documents rather than the Old and New
Testaments, are obviously not so much Christian schisms as
differentiations from historic Christianity&mdash;developments, in most
cases, of an abstract Christism on lines not merely Gentile but based
on Gentile religions, as against the Jewish. Broadly speaking,
therefore, they tended to disappear from the Christist field, inasmuch
as paganism had other deities better suited to the part of the Gnostic
<i>Logos</i>. The intermediate type, bodiless at best, must die out.
Gnosticism had not only no canon of its own, but no thought of one:
while the fashion lasted every decade saw a new system, refining on the
last and multiplying its abstractions, till the very term <i>gnosis</i>
must have become a byword. Success, as has been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>said
above, must remain with the simple and concrete system, especially if
that were organized; and the Gnostics of the second century attempted
no general organization. Yet Gnosticism left a lasting impress on
Christianity. In its earlier stages, as we have seen, it modified the
gospels; and after it had evolved away from the gospel basis it left an
influence on the more philosophically-minded writers of the Church,
notably Clement of Alexandria, who is as openly anxious to approve
himself a &ldquo;good Gnostic&rdquo; as to found on the accepted sacred
books of the Church. Deriving as it partly did from the Jewish
Platonist Philo, it brought into the Church his fashion of reducing
Biblical narratives to allegories&mdash;a course much resorted to not
only by Origen but by Augustine, and very necessary for the defence of
Hebrew tales against pagan criticism. Further, the regular practice of
the Church in the matter of separating catechumens from initiates was
an adoption of the Gnostic principle of esoteric knowledge.</p>
<p class="par">In yet other ways, however, Gnosticism influenced early
Christianity. It was the Gnostics who first set up in it literary
habits: they were the first to multiply documents of all kinds; and it
is not unlikely that their early additions to the gospels gave a
stimulus to its expansion on other lines. They were, in short, the
first to introduce a tincture of letters and art into the cult; and it
was their spirit that shaped the fourth gospel, which gave to Christism
the only philosophical elements it ever possessed. They are not indeed
to be regarded as having cultivated philosophy to any good purpose,
though they passed on some of the philosophic impulse to the later
Platonists. Rather the average Gnostic is to be conceived as a leisured
dilettante in an age of learned ignorance and foiled intelligence,
lending an eager ear to new mysticisms, as so many half-cultured idlers
are seen still doing in our own day. They cared as much for
abracadabral amulets, apparently, as for theories; and their zeal for
secret knowledge had in it something of the spirit of class
exclusiveness, and even of personal arrogance. It would seem as if,
when tyrannies in the ancient world made an end of the old moral
distinctions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>of classes, men instinctively caught at new ways
of being superior to their fellows&mdash;for the spirit of Gnosticism
arose among the later Greek pagans, who here followed the lead of
Egyptian priests, as well as among Samaritans and Grecized Jews. At
most we may say of the Gnostics that they were much more concerned than
the orthodox to frame a complete and consistent theistic theory of
things, and that in their learned-ignorant way they sought to walk by
reason as well as by faith. Necessarily they were in a minority. It
was, however, their theoretic bent, surviving in the gospel-reading
Church, that determined the dogmatic development of the Christist
creed. Their recoil from the conception of a Saviour-God in a human
body comes out in the later debates and creeds as in the fourth gospel;
and if the final doctrine of the Trinity be not truly Gnostic, it is
because the Gnostics showed more concern for plausibility, and never
aimed at tying thought down forever to a plainly self-contradictory
formula. Much of their movement probably survived in Manich&aelig;ism,
which, though sufficiently dogmatic, never flaunted such propositions
as those of the Nicene creed, and was a critical thorn in the flesh of
the Church. Even their amulets seem to have had a Christian vogue; and
the worship of angels, which began to flourish among Catholics in the
fourth century, seems to have been a reflex of their teaching.</p>
<p class="par">In some respects, finally, the modern Church has
confusedly reverted to their view of a future state. While the
&ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; Christians of the second century believed that
souls at death went to the under-world, to be raised with the body for
the approaching millennium, or thousand-years reign of Christ, the
Gnostics, scouting the millennium as a grossly materialistic
conception, held that at death the soul ascended to heaven. That
appears to be the prevailing fancy among Protestants at the present
day, though men have grown cautious of formal dicta on the subject.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">&sect; 4.</span> <i>Marcionism
and Montanism</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Apart from Gnosticism, the Church of the second
century was affected by certain heretical or sectarian movements which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>centred round single teachers of an influential
sort, in particular Marcion of Sinope and Montanus, who became the
founders of something like separate churches. Montanus, like
Manich&aelig;us, has mythical aspects; and it is impossible to be sure
of the historicity of either;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2276src" href=
"#xd21e2276" name="xd21e2276src">2</a> but Marcionism sets up no such
difficulty. Marcion, who was a disciple of the Gnostic Cerdo, and like
him flourished in the reign of Antoninus Pius, held by some of the main
Gnostic theories, but differed from the Gnostics in general in that he
founded solely on New Testament writings and did not absolutely oppose
Judaism. In his system the Supreme God, who is Good, creates a Demiurge
or world-maker, who is merely Just or legalist, the God of the Jews;
while Satan, the offspring of Matter, governs the heathens. Only the
Christians are ruled by the Good God, who is first revealed to men
solely by the Christ. It was in this way that he applied the Gnostic
principle of &ldquo;oppositions&rdquo; or &ldquo;antitheses,&rdquo; in
a work bearing that title. His ethic appears to have been a sectarian
version of that of Bardesanes, who had defined the good as those who
did good even to the wicked; the just as those who did good only to the
good; and the wicked as those who did evil even to the good. It does
not seem to have occurred to Marcion that in classing all pagans as
outside of the pale of goodness he was stultifying his own avowed
principle of divine love and mercy; but in this respect at least he was
not heretical, for all who bore the Christian name agreed in limiting
salvation to Christists, and dooming all other men to hell-fire.</p>
<p class="par">That he was a fanatic of exceptional force of character
is proved by the facts that (1) it was he who forced on the Church the
problem of a canon, he being the first to form one, by way, as he
explained, of excluding Jewish documents and Jewish interpolations in
the gospel and the Pauline epistles; and that (2) he was able to form a
separate organization, which subsisted for centuries, with some
variations in doctrine, alongside of the &ldquo;catholic&rdquo; Church,
being heard of as late as the eighth century. The controversies he set
up affected the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>whole literature of the Church for generations;
and though it was a point of honour with the orthodox to accuse him of
corrupting the texts as well as the faith, it is finally held that some
of his readings of the third gospel, which he specially favoured, are
really the original ones. Inasmuch, however, as he laid stress on
asceticism, to the extent of prohibiting marriage, he necessarily
failed to attract the multitude, though his was one of the influences
which fostered ascetic ideas within the Church from his time
onwards.</p>
<p class="par">The movement of Montanus, known also as the Cataphrygian
heresy, has two aspects&mdash;that of a sect apparently founded by a
zealot of strong personality, who felt that he had special inner light
and claimed (or was claimed) to be inspired by the Paraclete promised
in the gospel, and that of a general reaction against officialism in
the Church, somewhat in the spirit of the Quakers of the Reformation
period. It stressed all the extremer social tendencies of the early
Church, the prediction of the end of the world, the impropriety of
marriage and child-bearing in prospect of the catastrophe, the
multiplication of fasts, the absolute condemnation of second marriages,
the renunciation of earthly joys in general. Christ, said Montanus, had
withdrawn the indulgences granted by Moses; and through himself, the
Paraclete, cancelled those given by Paul. Thus true religion, having
had its infancy under Judaism, and its youth under the gospel, had
reached maturity under the Holy Spirit (an idea revived a thousand
years later in Catholic Europe). Hardness of heart had reigned till
Christ; weakness of flesh till the Paraclete. A special feature of the
Montanist schism&mdash;which spread far, and ultimately absorbed
Tertullian, who for a time had opposed it&mdash;was the association of
the founder with two wealthy women of rank, Maximilla and Priscilla,
who endowed the movement. It is noteworthy that this special growth of
asceticism took its rise in Phrygia, one of the regions specially
associated in pagan antiquity with sensuous and orgiastic worship. It
would seem as if an age of indulgence led in natural course to a
neurotic recoil. In any case it is neurosis that speaks in the ascetic
polemic of Tertullian, who became a typical Montanist. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Montanism, it has been said, was &ldquo;all but
victorious&rdquo;; but its victory was really impossible in the
circumstances. It would have meant arresting the growth of Christism to
the form of a moribund State Church by depriving it of all popular
attraction; and the vested interests were too great to permit of such a
renunciation. The movement may be loosely compared to the secession of
more rigid bodies from the relaxing sects of Methodism and Calvinism in
our own time: voluntary austerity must always be in a minority. A
Church which absolutely refused to retain or readmit any who committed
a cardinal sin or lapsed during persecution&mdash;saying they might be
saved by God&rsquo;s grace, but must not be allowed human
forgiveness&mdash;was doomed to the background. But Montanism,
appealing as it did to an ideal of holiness which the average Christian
dared not repudiate, influenced the main body, especially through the
writings of such a valued polemist as Tertullian, who taunted them with
being inferior even to many pagans in the matter of chastity and
monogamy. The main body was not to be metamorphosed; but it read the
lesson as inculcating the need for at least nominal priestly celibacy.
Every notable &ldquo;heresy&rdquo; so-called seems thus to have left
its mark on the Church.</p>
<p class="par">What above all is proved by the movements of Marcion and
Montanus is the power of organization in that period to maintain a sect
with sacred books of any kind. They had learned the lesson taken from
Judaism by the first Christists, and proceeded to show that just as
organized Jesuism could live apart from Judaism in the Gentile field,
so new Christist sects could live apart from the orthodox Church when
once separation was forced on them. Montanism, like Marcionism,
survived for centuries, and seems to have been at length suppressed
only by sheer violence on the part of the Christian emperors, who could
persecute far more effectually than pagans ever did, having the Church
as an instrument. In the face of such developments, and still more in
view of the later success of Manich&aelig;ism, which, as we shall see,
applied still better the principle of organization, there can be no
longer any difficulty in accounting for the rise of Christism on purely
natural <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>grounds. Given the recognition of a few
essential conditions, the creation of a sect was a very simple and
facile matter. Montanism and Manich&aelig;ism successively endured more
persecution, pagan and Christian, than the Christian Church ever did;
and it was only the essential unpopularity of the ideals of Montanism
that permitted of its suppression as a sect even by the persecuting
established Church. Manich&aelig;ism, as we shall see, was almost
insuppressible, even when political changes had given the Church a
power of centralization and coercion which otherwise could never have
been developed. At the end of the third century, in short, the Church
of its own nature was rapidly approaching disruption into new and
irreconcilable organizations.</p>

Ceremonies</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Apart from the habit of doctrinal discussion,
derived from Judaism, the Christianity of the third century had
distinctly become as much a matter of ritual and ceremonial as any of
the older pagan cults. Churches built for worship, rare in the second
century, had become common, and images had already begun to appear in
them, while incense was coming into general use, despite the earlier
detestation of it as a feature of idolatry. In the wealthier churches
gold and silver medals were often seen. Pagan example had proved
irresistible in this as in other matters.</p>
<p class="par">By this time baptism and the eucharist had alike become
virtual &ldquo;mysteries,&rdquo; to which new-comers were initiated as
in the pagan cults. Baptism was administered only twice a year, and
then only to those who had undergone a long preparation. The first
proceeding was a solemn exorcism, which was supposed to free the
initiates from the power of the evil spirit or spirits. Then, after
they had repeated a creed (which in the Western Churches had to be
recited both in Greek and Latin, the Greek being in the nature of a
magic formula), they were completely immersed, signed with the cross,
prayed over, and touched ceremonially with the hands of the officiating
bishop or presbyter; finally they partook of milk and honey, and
returned home decorated with a white robe and a crown. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The eucharist, commonly administered on Sundays, was
regarded as absolutely necessary to salvation and resurrection; and on
that account infants were made to partake of it, this before baptism
had been declared to be essential in their case. Only the baptized were
allowed to be present at the celebration; but portions of the
consecrated bread and wine were taken away for sick members, and
believed to have a curative virtue. The sign of the cross was now
constantly used in the same spirit, being held potent against physical
and spiritual evil alike, insofar as any such distinction was drawn.
But diseases, as among savages in all ages, were commonly regarded as
the work of evil spirits, and medical science was generally disowned,
the preferred treatment being exorcism. A baptized person might further
use the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, with its appeal against the Evil
One&mdash;a privilege denied to the catechumen or seeker for
membership.</p>

Primary Dogma</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The nucleus for a theistic-Christist creed, as we
have seen, was given to the Church in the fourth gospel. The first
Jewish Jesuists were simple Unitarians; and the Jesus of Paul, so far
as can be safely inferred from epistles indefinitely interpolated, was
certainly no part of a trinity in unity. At the beginning of the second
century the &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; Christists had no more definite
theology than had the unlettered believers in any pagan Saviour-God;
and at most the gospels taught them to regard the supernaturally-born
Christ as having ascended to heaven, to sit in visible form at the
right hand of the Father, as Herakles or Dionysos or Apollo might sit
by his Father Zeus. At the middle of the century Justin Martyr speaks
of the Logos not as a personal form of deity, but as the inspiration
given by God to men in different degrees at different times. It is
after him that the fourth gospel begins to do its work. Christian
apologists, deriding the beliefs of the pagans, had to meet the charge
that they too were polytheists, and the old pagan challenge, put to
pagans: If the suffering Saviour were a man, why worship him? if he
were a God, why weep for his sufferings? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">An attempt to meet the difficulty was made in the heresy
of Praxeas, a member of the Church who, coming from Asia to Rome late
in the century, seems to have taught that the Son and the Holy Spirit
were not distinct from the Father, but simply functions of the One God,
the Father having descended into the Virgin and been born as Jesus
Christ. At once he was accused of &ldquo;making the Father
suffer&rdquo; on the cross, and his sect accordingly seem to have been
among the first called <i>Patripassians</i>. In the same or the next
century No&euml;tus of Smyrna is found preaching the same doctrine; and
in the hands of Sabellius of Libya, whose name was given to it by his
opponents, the teaching became one of the most influential heresies of
the age. Sabellius in fact formulated that theory of the Trinity which
alone gives it formal plausibility: the three <i lang=
"la">person&aelig;</i> were for him (as they could etymologically be in
Latin and in the Greek term first used, <i>prosopon</i>) not persons,
but aspects or modes of the deity, as power, wisdom, and goodness; or
law, mercy, and guidance&mdash;a kind of solution which in later times
has captivated many theologians, including Servetus and Coleridge. But
Sabellius, like his predecessors, had to meet the epithet of
&ldquo;Patripassian,&rdquo; and he appears to have parried it with the
formula that only a certain energy proceeding from the Divine Nature
had been united to the man Jesus. In the way of rationalizing the
irrational and giving consistency to contradictories, the Church could
never do better than this. Under such a theorem, however, the Man-God
as such theoretically disappeared; and as that was precisely the side
of the creed which identified the cult, gave it popularity, and won it
revenue, Sabellianism, though accepted by many, even by many bishops,
could not become the official doctrine. It persistently remained,
nevertheless, in the background, the idea taking new forms and names in
succeeding generations, as new men arose with courage and energy enough
to reopen the insoluble strife, during a period of four hundred
years.</p>
<p class="par">A solution by a different approach was offered by such
second-century teachers as Theodotus of Byzantium, a learned tanner
living in Rome; another of the same name, a banker; and Artemon, all
founders of sects by whom Jesus was regarded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>as
merely a superior man, supernaturally born. As this form of the
Unitarian doctrine struck directly at the essential element of the
Christ&rsquo;s deity, in respect of which the cult vied with others of
the same type, it was no more generally acceptable than the Sabellian;
and it is more than likely that the mere <i>odium theologicum</i> gave
rise to the story that Theodotus had first denied Christ under
persecution, and then framed a theology for his predicament. Yet such
doctrines as his must have gone on gaining ground among the more
stirring minds; for when in the next century Paul of Samosata, bishop
of Antioch, began to restate the Unitarian thesis, he found an
extensive following. The Logos, he taught, was not a person distinct
from the Father, but merely his wisdom, which descended into but was
not united with Jesus. Given forth about the year 260, Paul&rsquo;s
teaching was condemned by a council at Antioch in 264, he giving a
promise of &ldquo;reformation&rdquo; which he did not keep. Another
council, which met in 269 or 270, deposed and excommunicated him; but
he refused to obey, and Queen Zenobia of Palmyra, who then ruled
Antioch, protected him. Not till 272, when Antioch was retaken by
Aurelian, did the majority succeed in ousting him, by the
emperor&rsquo;s express intervention. And still the
&ldquo;heresy&rdquo; persisted, and the theological hatreds grew. It
belonged to the nature of the religion, a pyramid poised on its apex,
to be in unstable equilibrium wherever any breath of reason could
blow.</p>
<p class="par">The development of the councils in the third century is
a proof at once of the growth of organization in the Church and of the
need for it. It is not to be supposed that all orthodox Churchmen
looked practically to the main chance; it is clear, on the contrary,
that many were moved by the conservative zeal of the Bibliolater of all
ages, as the heretics were presumably moved by a spirit of reason; but
the bishops must at all times have included many who looked at
questions of creed from the standpoint of finance, like so many members
of modern political parties; and they would be apt to turn the scale in
every serious dispute. Even they, however, with whatever aid from
polemical propaganda, could not long have <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>availed to preserve
anything like a preponderating main body if the Church were left to
itself. The polemical writers, broadly speaking, converted nobody, but
merely inflamed those already convinced; and party strife was becoming
more and more comprehensive, more furious, more menacing, when the
Church was saved from itself by the State. <span class=

<i>Persecutions</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was involved in the aggressive attitude of the
Christist movement that it should be persecuted by a partly
countervailing fanaticism. The original bias of all ancient religion,
indeed, in virtue of the simple self-interest of priesthoods, had been
to resent and suppress any new worship; and though nowhere else is the
course so ferociously enjoined as in the Hebrew sacred books, there are
many traces of it in the pagan world. Thus the Dionysiak cult had been
violently resisted on its introduction into Greece; and the early Roman
law against foreign worships was turned against it, under circumstances
plainly exaggerated by Livy, about 187 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>
Later a religious panic led to the official suppression in Rome of the
worships of Isis and Serapis. Empire, however, everywhere involved some
measure of official toleration of diverging cults; and as in Babylon
and Egypt, so under the Hellenistic and Roman systems, the religions of
each of the provinces were more or less assimilated in all. When even
early Athens had been constrained to permit the non-aggressive cults of
the aliens within her walls, far-reaching empires could do no less.
Indeed, the very vogue of Christism depended on the fact that
throughout the empire there was taking place a new facility of belief
in strange Gods. There can be no more complete mistake than the common
assertion that it made its appeal in virtue of the prevalence of
&ldquo;desolating scepticism.&rdquo; On the contrary, rationalism had
practically disappeared; and even the Roman pagans most adverse to
Christism were friendly to other new cults.</p>
<p class="par">Had the Christian cult been, like its non-Jewish
contemporaries, a mere effort to &ldquo;worship God according to
conscience,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107"
name="pb107">107</a>]</span>it need not have undergone pagan
persecution any more than they, or than Judaism, save when the State
imposed the duty of worshipping the emperor&rsquo;s statue. A God the
more was no scandal to polytheists. Christism had taken from Judaism,
however, as a first principle, the detestation of &ldquo;idols,&rdquo;
and its propaganda from the first had included a violent polemic
against them. For the Christians the pagan Gods were not unrealities:
they were evil d&aelig;mons, constantly active. Insofar, too, as the
first Jesuists in the western part of the empire shared the Jewish
hatred for Rome that is expressed in the Apocalypse, they were likely
enough to provoke Roman violence. A constant prediction of the speedy
passing away of all things was in itself a kind of sedition; and when
joined with contumely towards all other religions it could not but
rouse resentment. Thus, though the story of the great Neronian massacre
is, as already noted, an apparent fiction as regards the Christians,
being unnoticed in the book of Acts, Jesuists and Jews alike ran many
chances of local or general hostility under the empire from the first.
The express doctrines, put in the mouth of the founder, that he had
come to bring not peace but a sword, and to create strife in families,
were not fitted to soften the prejudices aroused by the religious
claims of the new faith; and in the time of Tertullian they were
defined in the west as &ldquo;enemies of the Gods, of the emperors, of
the laws, of morals, and of all nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">According to Tertullian, writing under Severus or
Caracalla, only the bad emperors had persecuted the Church. But its
danger had always lain less in special imperial edicts than in the
ordinary bearing of the laws against secret societies and nocturnal
worships, and in the ordinary tendency of ignorant and priest-led
fanaticism to a panic of cruelty in times of popular distress or alarm.
An earthquake or pestilence was always apt to be visited on the new
&ldquo;atheists&rdquo; as provokers of the Gods. The mere habit of
midnight worship, which is one of the proofs that early Jesuism was in
some way affiliated to sun-worship, was a ground for suspicion; but as
Mithraism was freely tolerated in spite of its nocturnal rites,
Christism might have been, but for its other provocations. And even
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>these were for long periods ignored by the
Government. If the often-quoted letter of Pliny to Trajan (about the
year 100) be genuine, it proves an official disposition to protect the
Christians, when politically innocent, from fanatical attacks; and
Tertullian, who speaks of such a letter, credits Marcus Aurelius with
limiting the scope of the laws which tended to injure the sect, though
we know from Marcus himself that Christians suffered death. By common
consent, though there was certainly much random persecution in the
first three centuries, the formula of &ldquo;ten persecutions&rdquo; is
fabulous; and that ascribed to Domitian is hardly better established
than that ascribed to Nero. That the Christists suffered specially as
tradition asserts in the reign of Hadrian, when the Jews were specially
hated because of their last desperate revolt, is probable; but Hadrian
gave no general orders, and is credited like the Antonines with
shielding the new sectaries. It is finally very doubtful whether any
ordained and legalized persecution of Christians ever took place save
(1) in Egypt under Severus, who at first and afterwards was friendly;
(2) on a small scale under Maximinus; (3) in the east under Decius and
(4) under Valerian; and (5) throughout the empire under Diocletian and
his colleagues (from 303 to 311). These episodes occurred within a
period of little over a hundred years.</p>
<p class="par">In all periods alike, from the end of the first century
down to Constantine, there was no doubt much chronic cruelty. The
letter from the Churches of Vienne and Lyons, cited by Eusebius and
assigned to the year 161, is a doubtful document; but the savageries
there described were only too possible. Public cruelty seems to have
worsened in the very period in which the inhabitants of cities had
become most unused to war, and the finer minds had grown most humane;
like the other animal instincts, it had grown neurotic in conditions of
vicious idleness, and many men had become virtuosi in cruelty as in
lust. The Christian gospel itself now held up &ldquo;the
tormentors&rdquo; as typical of the processes of divine punishment; and
torture was for many an age to be a part of Christian as of pagan legal
procedure. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Insofar as persecution was legalized, it is to be
understood not as a putting down of a new religious belief, but as an
attack on its political and social side. In the case, for instance, of
Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, who after a flight and a banishment was
put to death under Valerian and Gallienus (258), the bishop&rsquo;s
far-reaching activities are the presumptive reason for his fate. It is
to be remembered, as Gibbon notes, that in ten years of Cyprian&rsquo;s
tenure of office four emperors themselves died by the sword, with their
families and their adherents. At times, no doubt, the attack on
Christians was unprovoked, consisting as it might in a challenge to a
Christian to swear allegiance by or sacrifice to the statue of the
emperor, when he was willing to swear by his own creed. The public
worship of the emperor was the one semblance of a centralized religious
organization which, like that of the Christian Church, existed
throughout the empire. Precedented by old Egyptian and eastern usage,
and by the practice of Alexander and his successors, it had first
appeared in Rome in the offer of the cringing senate to deify Julius
C&aelig;sar, and in the systematic measures of Augustus to have Julius
worshipped as a God (<i>divus</i>), an honour promptly accorded to
himself in turn. The apotheosis was signalized by giving the names of
Julius and Augustus to the months Quintilis and Sextilis; and only the
final unpopularity of Tiberius prevented the substitution of his name
in turn for that of September, an honour offered to and refused by him
in his earlier life.</p>
<p class="par">Some of the madder emperors later tried to carry on the
process of putting themselves in the calendar, but were duly disobeyed
after death. Detested emperors, such as Tiberius and Nero and Domitian,
were even refused the apotheosis; but in general the title of
<i>divus</i> was freely accorded, so abject had the general mind grown
under autocracy; and it was usual in the provinces to worship the
living emperor in a special temple in association with the Genius of
Rome; while the cults of some emperors lasted long after their death.
The common sense as well as the sense of humour of some rulers led them
to make light of the institution; and the jest of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>dying Vespasian, &ldquo;I fancy I am turning
God,&rdquo; is one of several imperial witticisms on the subject; but
it lay in the nature of autocracy, in Rome as in Egypt or in Incarian
Peru, to employ sagaciously all methods of abasing the human spirit, so
as to secure the safety of the throne. One of the most obvious means
was to deify the emperor&mdash;a procedure as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; in
that age as the deification of Jesus, and depending on the same
psychological conditions. And though the person of the emperor was
seldom quite safe from assassination by his soldiery, the imperial cult
played its part from the first in establishing the fatal ideal of
empire. No sequence of vileness or incompetence in the emperors, no
impatience of the insecurity set up by the power of the army to make
and unmake the autocrat, no experience of the danger of a war of
claimants, ever seems to have made Romans dream of a saner and nobler
system. Manhood had been brought too low.</p>
<p class="par">Imperialism being thus an official religion in itself,
the cult of the emperor lay to the hands of any magistrate who should
be disposed to put a test to a member of the sect which decried all
established customs and blasphemed all established Gods. It was the
recognized way of imposing the oath of allegiance apart from any
specific law. Where such a procedure was possible, any malicious pagan
might bring about a stedfast Christian&rsquo;s death. There is
Christian testimony, however, that many frenzied believers brought
martyrdom wilfully on themselves by outrages on pagan temples and
sacred statues; and it is Tertullian who tells how Arrius Antoninus,
pro-consul in Asia, drove from him a multitude of frantic fanatics
seeking death, with the amazed demand to know whether they had not
ropes and precipices. The official temper evidently varied, as did that
of the Christians. In the period before Diocletian, save for the
intrigues of pagan priests and provincial demagogues, and the normal
suspicions of autocratic power, there was nothing in the nature of a
general and official animosity, though the Christian attitude was
always unconciliatory enough. But by the beginning of the fourth
century the developments on both sides had created a situation of
strain and danger. The great effort of Diocletian to give <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>new
life to the vast organism of the empire, first by minute supervision,
and then by sub-division under two emperors, called Augusti, and two
C&aelig;sars, wrought a certain seriousness of political interest
throughout the bureaucracy; and the Christian body, long regarded with
alternate contempt and dislike, had become so far organized and so
considerable a force that none who broadly considered the prospects of
the State could avoid reckoning with it.</p>
<p class="par">At the same time paganism had taken on new guises: the
Neo-Platonists, so-called, restated the ancient mythology and theology
in forms which compared very well with the abstract teaching of the
Church; and among the educated class there was some measure of
religious zeal against Christians as blasphemers of other men&rsquo;s
Gods. It may or may not have needed the persuasion of his
anti-Christian colleague, the C&aelig;sar Galerius, to convince such a
ruler as Diocletian that the Christian Church, a growing State within
the State, still standing by an official doctrine of a speedy
world&rsquo;s-end, and rejecting the cult of the emperor, was an
incongruous and dangerous element in the imperial scheme. It was in
fact a clear source of political weakness, though not so deadly a one
as the autocracy itself. To seek to suppress it, accordingly, was
almost a natural outcome of Diocletian&rsquo;s ideal of government. He
had sought to give a new air of sanctity to the worship of the emperor
by calling himself <i>Jovius</i> and his colleague Maximian
<i>Herculius</i>; and to make the effort succeed it might well seem
necessary to crush the one cult that directly stood in the way, alike
as a creed and as an organization. The refusal of some Christian
soldiers, too, to submit to certain commands which they considered
unlawful gave Galerius a special pretext for strong measures.</p>
<p class="par">It is not to be forgotten that the emperors and the
bureaucracy had some excuse for a policy of suppression in the bitter
strifes of the Christian sects and sections. Eusebius confesses that
these were on the verge of actual warfare, bishop against bishop and
party against party, each seeking for power; and for all it was a
matter of course to accuse opponents of the worst malpractices. Some of
the darkest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>charges brought by the pagans against Christians
in general were but distributions of those brought by the orthodox
against heretics, and by Montanists and others against the orthodox. A
credulous pagan might well believe that all alike carried on vile
midnight orgies, and deserved to be refused the right of meeting. It is
not probable, however, that the two emperors and the persecuting
C&aelig;sar proceeded on any concern for private morals; and though
Galerius was a zealous pagan with a fanatical mother, the motive of the
persecution was essentially political. What happened was that the
passions of the zealots among the pagans had now something like free
scope; and, unless the record in Eusebius is sheer fable, the work was
often done with horrible cruelty. On the other hand, there is Christian
testimony to the humanity of many of the better pagans, who sheltered
their Christian friends and relatives; and the C&aelig;sar Constantius
Chlorus, a tolerant pagan, who ruled in Gaul and Britain and Spain,
gave only a formal effect to the edict of the emperors, destroying
churches and sacred books, but sparing their owners. The fact, finally,
that in ten years of persecution the number of victims throughout the
eastern and central empire appears to have been within two thousand,
goes to suggest that the mass of the Christians either bowed to the
storm or eluded it. Bitter discussions, reviving some of the previous
century, rose afterwards as to the proper treatment of the
<i>traditores</i>, those who surrendered and forswore themselves; and
the more zealous sects and churches either imposed long penances or
refused to receive back the lapsed. As the latter course would only
weaken themselves, the majority of the churches combined policy with
penalty.</p>
<p class="par">The time was now at hand when the Church, from being an
object of aversion to the autocracy, was to become its instrument. Just
before his death in 311, Galerius, who was little of a statesman, began
to see what Diocletian would doubtless have admitted had he lived much
longer, and what Constantius Chlorus had probably suggested to his
colleagues, that the true policy for the government was to adopt
instead of crushing the Christian organization. Only the original
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>anticivism of the cult, probably, had prevented
a much earlier adoption of this view by the more politic emperors. It
was the insistence on the imminent end of the world, the preaching of
celibacy, the disparagement of earthly dignitaries, the vehement
assault on the standing cults of the State, no less than the refusal to
sacrifice to the emperor&rsquo;s statue, that had so long made
Christism seem the natural enemy of all civil government. The more the
Church grew in numbers and wealth, however, the more its bishops and
priests tended to conform to the ordinary theory of public life; and as
theirs was now the only organization of any kind that reached far
throughout the State, save the State itself and the cult of the
emperors, the latter must evidently either destroy it or adopt it. The
great persecution, aiming at the former end, served only to show the
futility of official persecution for such a purpose, since pagans
themselves helped to screen staunch Christians, and the weaker had but
to bow before the storm. Already Constantine, acting with a free hand
on his father&rsquo;s principles, had given complete tolerance to the
Christians under his sway; and Maxentius, struggling with him for the
mastery of the West, had done as much. Even in the East, Maximin had
alternately persecuted and tolerated the Christians as he had need to
press or pacify Galerius. The language used by Galerius, finally, in
withdrawing the edict of persecution, suggests that besides recognizing
its failure he had learned from his opponents to conceive the
possibility of attaching to the autocracy a sect so much more widely
organized and so much more zealous than any of the other subsisting
popular religions, albeit still numbering only a fraction of the whole
population.</p>
<p class="par">To many of the Christians, on the other hand, long
persecution had doubtless taught the wisdom of recanting the extremes
of doctrine which had made even sceptical statesmen regard them as a
danger to any State. It is clear that bishops like Eusebius of
C&aelig;sarea would readily promise to the government a loyal attention
to its interests in the event of its tolerating and befriending the
Church; and the sacred books offered texts for any line of public
action. The empire, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114"
name="pb114">114</a>]</span>always menaced by barbarism on its
frontiers, needed every force of union that could be used within; and
here, finally adaptable to such use, was the one organization that
acted or was fitted to act throughout the whole. To the leading
churchmen, finally, association with the State was the more welcome
because on the one hand general persecution would cease, and on the
other all the party leaders could hope to be able by the State&rsquo;s
means to put down their opponents. A generation before, in the year
272, the Emperor Aurelian, on the express appeal of the party of
bishops who had deposed Paul of Samosata, had intervened in that
quarrel to give effect to the will of the majority, which otherwise
could not have been put in force; and such occasions were sure to arise
frequently. It needed only another innovating emperor to bring about
the coalition thus prepared.</p>

and Creed-Making</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the abdication of the co-emperors Diocletian
and Maximian, the C&aelig;sars, Galerius and Constantius Chlorus,
became the Augusti; the former, as senior, taking the East, and the
latter the West. At once the plans of Diocletian began to miscarry; and
Galerius, instead of raising to the C&aelig;sarship, as the other had
wished, Maxentius the son of Maximian and Constantine the already
distinguished son of Constantius, gave the junior titles to his nephews
Severus and Maximin. The speedy death of Constantius, however, secured
the election of Constantine to the purple by his father&rsquo;s troops
in Britain; and there ensued the manifold strifes which ended in
Constantine&rsquo;s triumph. Maxentius, and his father, who returned to
power, put down Severus; and Maximian gave his daughter as wife to
Constantine, thus creating a state of things in which three emperors
were leagued against a fourth and one C&aelig;sar. Soon Maximian and
Maxentius quarrelled, the father taking refuge first with Constantine
and later with Galerius; who, however, proceeded to create yet another
emperor, Licinius. Immediately the C&aelig;sar Maximin revolted, and
forced Galerius to make him Augustus also. The old Maximian in the
meantime went to league himself afresh <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>with Constantine,
who, finding him treacherous, had him strangled. Soon after, Galerius
dying (in 311), Maximin and Licinius joined forces; while Maxentius,
who held Italy and Africa, professing to avenge his father, declared
war on Constantine, who held Gaul. The result was the defeat and death
of the former, leaving Constantine master of the whole West (312). In
314 he fell out with Licinius, who had in the meantime destroyed
Maximin, and won from him Illyrium, Macedonia, and Greece. For ten
years thereafter Constantine divided the empire with Licinius; then,
quarrelling afresh with his rival, he captured and strangled him, and
was sole autocrat (324).</p>
<p class="par">Out of this desperate drama emerged Christianity as the
specially favoured cult of the Roman empire. Constantine, we saw, had
protected the Christians from the first, as his father had done before
him; and Licinius had acquiesced in the same policy, though in his
final war with Constantine he persecuted the Christians in order to
attach pagans to his cause. There has been much discussion,
nevertheless, as to whether Constantine turned Christian on political
or on religious grounds. The fact seems to be that, in the ordinary
spirit of ancient religion, he trusted to have the support of the God
of the Christians in his great struggle with Maxentius, who appealed to
the Gods of paganism with old and evil rites; and that after his first
great success he became more and more confirmed in his choice. The
story, however, of his having the <i>labarum</i> presented to him in a
dream or a vision is an obvious fiction, possible only to the ignorance
of the first Christian historians, who read the Greek letters
<span class="trans" title="Chr"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Chi;&rho;</span></span> (Chr)&mdash;though the tradition ran
that the accompanying words, &ldquo;In this sign conquer,&rdquo; were
in Latin&mdash;in a solar symbol that had appeared on Egyptian and
other coins many centuries before, and had no reference whatever to the
name of Christ, though Constantine used it for that on his standards. A
similar tale is told of his son Constantius, on whose coins, however,
the symbol is associated with the pagan Goddess of Victory. For the
rest, Constantine was a Christian like another. His father had been a
monotheist, who protected the Christians on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>philosophical principles; and from the constant
success of Constantius in all his undertakings, as compared with the
ill fortune of his own rivals, the son argued that the religion of
&ldquo;One God&rdquo; was propitious to his house. His personal success
in war was always his main argument for the Christian creed, and in
such an age it was not the least convincing. The fact that he postponed
his baptism till shortly before his death is not to be taken as
necessarily indicating any religious hesitations on his part, though
such hesitation may have been his motive. Multitudes of Christians in
that age did the same thing, on the ground that baptism took away all
sin, and that it was bad economy to receive it early. In his case such
a reason was specially weighty, and there is no decisive reason to
suppose that he had any other of a religious nature. Since, however,
the pagans still greatly outnumbered the Christians, he could not
afford to declare definitely against all other cults; and, beginning by
decreeing toleration for all, he kept the pagan title of <i>pontifex
maximus</i>, and continued through the greater part of his life to
issue coins or medals on which he figured as the devotee of Apollo or
Mars or Herakles or Mithra or Zeus.</p>
<p class="par">While, however, he thus propitiated other Gods and
worshippers, he gave the Christians from the first a unique financial
support. Formerly, the clergy in general had been wont to supplement
their monthly allowances by trading, farming, banking, by handicraft,
and by practising as physicians; but the emperor now enacted that they
should have regular annual allowances, and that the church&rsquo;s
widows and virgins should be similarly supported. Further, not only did
he restore the possessions taken from believers during the persecution,
he enacted that all their priests, like those of Egypt and of the later
empire in general, should be exempt from municipal burdens; a step as
much to their interest as it was to the injury of the State and of all
public spirit. The instant effect was to draw to the priesthood
multitudes of gain-seekers; the churches of Carthage and Constantinople
soon had 500 priests apiece; and so strong were the protests of the
municipalities against the financial disorder he had created that
Constantine was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117"
name="pb117">117</a>]</span>fain to restrict his decree. Certainly
pagan flamens and public priests of the provinces, a restricted class,
had had the same privilege, and this he maintained for them despite
Christian appeals; nor does he seem to have withdrawn it from the
priests and elders of the Jewish synagogues, who had also enjoyed it;
but his direct gifts to the churches were considerable, and by
permitting them to receive legacies in the manner of the pagan temples
he established their financial basis. So great was their gain that laws
had to be passed limiting the number of the clergy; and from this time
forward laws were necessary to restrain priests and bishops from
further enriching themselves by lending at interest.</p>
<p class="par">Clerical power, however, was still further extended.
Bishops, who had hitherto acted as arbitrators in Christian disputes,
had their decisions legally enforced; and the important legal process
of freeing slaves was transferred from the temples to the churches.
Some pagan temples he temporarily suppressed, on moral grounds; some he
allowed to be destroyed as no longer in use; but though he built and
richly endowed several great Christian churches and passed some laws
against pagan practices, he never ventured on the general persecution
of pagans which his Christian hangers-on desired; and the assertions of
Eusebius as to his having plundered the temples and brought paganism
into contempt are among the many fictions&mdash;some of them perhaps
later forgeries&mdash;in the works of that historian. As it was,
Christian converts were sufficiently multiplied. Constantine&rsquo;s
severest measures were taken against private divination, the practisers
of which he ordered to be burnt alive; but here he acted on the
standing principles of pagan law, and doubtless under the usual
autocratic fear of soothsaying against himself. The measure of course
had no effect on popular practice. The emperors themselves usually
consulted diviners before their own accession; and their veto on
divination for other people was thus not impressive.</p>
<p class="par">It is in his relations to his chosen church, code, and
creed that Constantine figures at his worst. In the year after his
victory over Licinius, when he was ostensibly a doubly convinced
Christian, he put to death his son Crispus, a nephew, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>and
his wife, Fausta; and he had strangled Licinius and <i>his</i> son
after promising to preserve their lives; but not a word of censure came
from the Christian clergy. At one stroke, their whole parade of
superior morality was gone; and the Church thenceforth was to be in the
main as zealous a sycophant of thrones as the priests of the past had
ever been. Constantine lived without rebuke the ordinary life of
autocrats; and by the admission of his episcopal panegyrist he was
surrounded by worthless self-seekers, Christians all. Such as he was,
however, Constantine was joyfully accepted as head of the Church on
earth. His creation of the new capital, Constantinople, was regarded as
the beginning of a new era, that of Christianity; since the upper
classes of Rome were the most zealous devotees of the old Gods, and
were said to have received Constantine on his last visit with open
disrespect. Remaining <i>pontifex maximus</i>, he presided over the
&OElig;cumenical Council of the Church; and one of the abuses he
established was to put the entire imperial postal service, with its
relays of horses and chariots, at the service of the bishops travelling
to attend them. For all his efforts he had the reward of seeing them
quarrel more and more furiously over their central dogmas and over
questions of discipline. Under his eyes there arose the great schism of
Arius, and the schism of the Donatists in Africa, both destined to
deepen and worsen for many generations. The failure of the Church as a
means of moral union becomes obvious once for all as soon as the act of
establishment has removed the only previous restraining force on
Christian quarrels, fear of the pagan enemy. Clerical revenues being
mostly local, schism was still no economic disadvantage to any sectary;
and the Christian creed availed as little to overrule primary instincts
of strife as to provide rational tests for opinion or action.</p>
<p class="par">It would seem as if whatever mental impulse was left in
men must needs run in the new channels opened up for ignorant energy by
ecclesiasticism and theology in that world of deepening ignorance and
waning civilization. Literature as such was vanishing; art was growing
more impotent reign by reign; and the physical sciences, revived for a
time in their refuge at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href=
"#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>Alexandria by the Antonines and
Flavians, were being lost from the hands of the living. To attribute
the universal decadence to Christianity would be no less an error than
the old falsism that it was a force of moral and civic regeneration: it
was an effect rather than a cause of the general lapse. But, once
established as part of the imperial machinery, it hastened every
process of intellectual decay; and under such circumstances moral gain
could not be. A doctrine of blind faith could not conceivably save a
world sinking through sheer lack of light.</p>
<p class="par">To Constantine, the endless strifes of the clergy over
their creeds were as unintelligible as they were insoluble. Like the
centurion of the gospel story, wont to command and to be obeyed, he
looked for discipline in divine things; and as the theological feud
became more and more embroiled he passed from uneasiness to a state
between fear and rage. The <i>Divinitas</i>, he protested, would be
turned against all, clergy and emperor and laity alike, if the clergy
would not live at peace; and he quaintly besought them to leave points
of theory alone, or else to imitate the pagan philosophers, who could
debate without hatred. The ever-quarrelling Church was becoming a
laughing-stock to the Pagans, being derided in the very theatres; and
its new converts could be those only who went wherever there was chance
of gain. So, in one of his rages, he decreed murderous punishment
against intractable schismatics, only to find that the menace had
multiplied the offence. Such as it was, however, the Church was an
instrument of autocratic organization not to be dispensed with; and
thus, at the stage at which its theological impulses, unchecked by sane
moral feeling, would in the absence of persecution by the State have
rent it in mutually destroying factions, the official protection of the
State in turn came in to hold it together as a nominal unity. Thus and
thus did the organism survive&mdash;by anything rather than moral
vitality or intellectual virtue.</p>
<p class="par">Leaving to the councils the settlement or unsettlement
of dogmas, the emperor took upon himself, to the great satisfaction of
the clergy, the whole external administration of the Church,
assimilating it to his body politic. The four leading <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>bishoprics&mdash;Rome, Antioch, Alexandria, and
Constantinople&mdash;were put on a level with the four pr&aelig;torian
prefectures; under them were ecclesiastical exarchs, corresponding to
the thirteen civil exarchs of given territories or dioceses; and next
came metropolitans or archbishops who superintended the single
provinces, 116 in all. In the next century, the Bishop of Jerusalem,
formerly subject to Antioch, became independent; and those five sees
became known as the five Patriarchates. Numbers of churches still
remained for various reasons technically independent; but the natural
effect of the whole system was to throw all authority upwards, the
bishops overriding the presbyters, and all seeking to limit the power
of the congregations to interfere. As the latter would now include an
increasing number of indifferentists, the development was the more
easy. On the side of external ceremony, always the gist of the matter
for the majority, as well as in myth and theory, Christianity had now
assimilated nearly every pagan attraction: baptism, as aforesaid, was
become a close copy of an initiation into pagan mysteries, being
celebrated twice a year by night with a blaze of lights; and when
Constantine enacted that the Day of the Sun should be treated as
specially holy, he was merely bracketing together pagan and Christian
theology, the two sanctions being equally involved. It was of course
not a sacred day in the modern Puritan sense, being simply put on a
level with the other great festival days of the State, on which no work
was done, but play was free.</p>
<p class="par">It was in the year after his attainment of the sole
power that Constantine summoned a General Council at his palace of
Nic&aelig;a in Bithynia (325), to settle the theological status of the
founder of the Church. The question had been ostensibly decided as
against Paul of Samosata and the Sabellians (who made the Son a mere
manifestation or aspect of the Father) by the dictum that they were
different persons. That was for the time orthodox dogma. When, however,
Arius, a presbyter of Alexandria, declared as against his bishop that
&ldquo;the Son is totally and essentially distinct from the
Father,&rdquo; the trouble began afresh. Arius found many adherents,
who accused the bishop of Sabellianizing when he affirmed that the Son
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>the Father were of the same essence; and the
Church saw itself once more driven to define its God. Bishop Alexander
had Arius cast out of the Church by two Alexandrian Councils, with the
effect of driving him to a more zealous propaganda, which succeeded as
promptly and as widely as any previous heresy. Thereupon the Council of
Nic&aelig;a, by a majority vote, enacted that the Son was of the same
essence (<i>homoousios</i>) with the Father, yet a different person,
and one-with yet born-of the Father; a creed to that effect was framed;
Arius was sent into exile; and the leading bishops on his side were
deposed. It was a mere snatch vote by a packed jury, since only some
300 bishops were present, whereas the Church contained at least 1,800;
and five years afterwards Constantine, who on his own part had ordered
that the writings of Arius should be burned, yet expressed himself as
an ultra-Arian, became persuaded that the heresiarch had been ill-used,
and recalled him from exile. Thereupon the restored Arian bishops began
to persecute their persecutors; and Athanasius the new bishop of
Alexandria having refused to reinstate Arius, <i>he</i> in turn was
deprived of his office by the Council of Tyre (335) and banished to
Gaul, other depositions following; while a large council held at
Jerusalem formally restored the Arians; and the emperor commanded the
bishop of Constantinople to receive the heresiarch. Before this could
be done, however, Arius died at Constantinople (336), apparently by
poison, and Constantine died the year after, baptized by an Arian
bishop, leaving the two parties at grips for their long wrestle of
hate. Within a few years, the emperor&rsquo;s son Constans was
threatening to make war on his brother Constantine if he did not
reinstate Athanasius.</p>
<p class="par">No more insane quarrel had ever convulsed any society.
As an ecclesiastical historian has remarked, both parties believed in
salvation through the blood of Jesus: on this primitive dogma,
inherited from prehistoric barbarism, there was no dispute: and the
battle was over the hopeful point of &ldquo;assigning him that rank in
the universe which properly belonged to him.&rdquo; Orthodoxy would
have it that the Son was Son from all eternity&mdash;exactly, once
more, as devout Brahmans and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>Moslems have maintained that the
Vedas and the Koran were &ldquo;uncreated,&rdquo; and existed from all
eternity. Man&rsquo;s instinct of reverence seems to lead mechanically
to such conceptions in the absence of critical thought. But the
thought, on the other side, which made Jesus a God born in time, and
<i>homoiousios</i> (of <i>similar</i> essence) with the Father, was
only relatively saner. Thus the Arians, rational in one aspect, took
their stand on a fundamental irrationality; while the Trinitarians, as
represented by Athanasius, found a sufficient substitute for argument
in boundless vituperation. The fact that the Arians opposed monasticism
and the ideal of perpetual virginity served to heighten orthodox
resentment. The hatred was beyond all measure, and can be accounted for
only by recognizing that a creed which appeals to emotion and degrades
reason is potentially the worst stimulant of evil passions. On the
intellectual side, if it can be said to have had one, the theory of the
Trinity was a simple appropriation by Christianity of the conception of
divine Triads which prevailed in the old Egyptian and other systems;
and of which the Trinity of Osiris, Isis, and Horus was a well-known
instance. Athanasius was but adding Christian passion to yet another
pagan theorem, assimilated on Gnostic lines, with a new stress laid on
the verbal affirmation of monotheism.</p>
<p class="par">The one quasi-rational argument applicable to the case
would be the non-moral one that the cult was visibly between the Scylla
of polytheism and the Charybdis of a monotheism which reduced Jesus to
mere manhood; and that if a nakedly self-contradictory formula could
preserve it from collapse on either side such a formula should be
enacted. Such an argument was of course not put forward, but probably
it appealed to some of the shrewder and less honest bishops, who in the
ensuing strifes would nevertheless adapt themselves to the political
urgency of the moment. The State had happily created a species of
official pale, within which the warring members remained nominally one
church. Within that superficies the chaos became indescribable. The
Arians in their turn broke up into half-a-dozen mutually anathematizing
sects, each brandishing a creed; and every new phase of heresy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>evoked orthodox rejoinders which in turn were
found to be heresies in the other direction. On the first series of
strifes followed a second, as to the manner of the combination of the
divine and human natures in Jesus; with yet a third, over the
personality or modality of the Holy Ghost; till theology had become a
kind of systematic insanity.</p>
<p class="par">While Egypt and the East were thus embroiled, northern
Africa, &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; on the Trinity, was being given up to
the schism of the Donatists, one of the many outbreaks of the Puritan
or ascetic instinct there, where of old had flourished some of the most
sensual worships. The quarrel began over the election of a bishop of
Carthage, and the puritan side received its title from one or both of
two bishops named Donatus. Council after council failed to compose the
feud; and the emperor fared no better when he took from the schismatics
some of their temples, banished some of their bishops, and put numbers
to death. In the year 330 one of their councils numbered 270 bishops;
and still the schism went on growing. Any sect, it was clear, might
grow as the Jesuist sect itself had done. Alongside of the others now
arose yet a new movement, named after its semi-legendary founder,
Manich&aelig;us or Manes, a Persian, which combined in Gnostic fashion
the Christian scheme and that of Mazdean dualism, identifying Jesus
with Mithra; and this cult in turn, being carefully organized, spread
fast and far, flourishing all the more because Manes was believed to
have been put to death by the Persian king as a heretic to Mazdeism (?
275). It had a president, representing Christ; twelve masters,
representing the twelve apostles; and seventy-two bishops, representing
the seventy-two apostles of the third gospel or the seventy-two
travelling collectors of the Jewish patriarchs. Like most of the
earlier Gnostics the Manich&aelig;ans were &ldquo;Docetists,&rdquo;
holding that Jesus had only a seeming body and could not really suffer;
and they not only denounced the Old Testament, calling Jehovah the Evil
Spirit, but rejected the four gospels in favour of a new one, called
Erteng, which Manes claimed to have been dictated to him by God.
Improving on Montanus, he claimed, or was made to claim, to be the
promised Paraclete; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124"
name="pb124">124</a>]</span>thus beginning a new creed on all fours
with the Christist. On the side of ethics the new cult extolled and
professed all the ascetic virtues, and held by a theory of a twofold
purgatory, one of sacred water in the moon, and one of sacred fire in
the sun, which burned away the impure body, leaving an immortal spirit.
Giving out its independent gospel, Manich&aelig;ism had all the popular
vitality of Montanism with the intellectual pretensions of Gnosticism.
Nothing, it was clear, could hinder the creation of new sects out of or
alongside the main body; and nothing but the most systematic and
destructive persecution could prevent their separate continuance while
zeal subsisted.</p>
<p class="par">Under the family of Constantine his creed and his policy
were maintained, with no better fruits under either the personal or the
political aspect. To his three sons&mdash;Constantine II, Constantius,
and Constans&mdash;with two of his nephews, he left the empire; but
immediately the nephews were massacred with their fathers; of the three
sons the second destroyed the first in war (340); and the third,
succeeding to the western provinces of the first, fell in war with a
new competitor, Magnentius (350); whereafter Constantius, defeating the
latter by deputy, became sole emperor (353&ndash;361). To him appears
to be chargeable the deliberate assassination at one stroke of the two
surviving brothers of his father and all their sons save two, Gallus
and Julian, the sons of Julius Constans; and at his hands began at
least the theoretical persecution of paganism on the eager pressure of
the church which forty years before had been persecuted. It thus
remains matter of history that while many pagans had been in favour of
tolerance before the establishment of Christianity, the Christians, who
had naturally condemned all persecution while they suffered from it,
were ready to become zealous persecutors as soon as they had the power.
The treatise of Julius Firmicus Maternus on pagan errors is an eager
appeal to the sons of Constantine to destroy all pagan worships. In
point of fact, pagans were not the first to suffer. Excommunications,
banishments, and executions of schismatics had been among the first
fruits of Constantine&rsquo;s headship; and though for a time many
recoiled from putting to death their heretical fellow-Christians,
within a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>century that scruple too had disappeared. Thus
again was &ldquo;the Church&rdquo; enabled to survive.</p>
<p class="par">Christian persecution of paganism, on the other hand,
did not take effect as promptly as its instigators would seem to have
wished. In 341, Constans made an absurd law that &ldquo;superstition
should cease, and the madness of sacrifices be abolished,&rdquo; on
pain of death to all who persisted. No official action seems to have
been taken under this decree; and next year, being doubtless forced to
respect the pagan party, he enacted that though superstition must be
suppressed the old temples should be spared. In 353, Constantius in
turn appears from the Theodosian Code to have decreed that all temples
throughout the empire should be closed; that all who resorted to them
or offered sacrifice should be put to death, and their property
confiscated; and that governors who did not enforce the law should
themselves be so punished. In the same year he ostensibly struck at
nocturnal pagan rites at Rome, where Christian rites had so long been
nocturnal. Three years later, when Julian had become C&aelig;sar under
him, he framed a law, signed by both, which in a few words reaffirms
the death penalty on all who sacrificed, or worshipped idols&mdash;this
when some Christians were already worshipping idols in their churches.
As there is no trace whatever of any official action being taken under
these laws, and as there is abundant monumental proof that at least in
the western empire and in Egypt the pagan worships were carried on
freely as before, we are forced to conclude that the edicts, if really
penned, were never given out by Constantius. It remains on record that
he, keeping the pagan title of <i>pontifex maximus</i>, passed
stringent laws, as Constans had done, against all who desecrated pagan
tombs; and further that he went on paying the stipends of flamens,
augurs, and vestals&mdash;personages usually of high rank. It appears
that in fact the autocrat could not or dared not yet enforce his laws
against the pagan worships. In the East in general, however, and even
in Italy, wherever temples were unfrequented and ill defended they were
liable to shameless plunder or destruction by Christians, who were safe
from punishment.</p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, Constantius multiplied the financial
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>privileges of Christians, giving higher stipends
to the clergy and doles of corn to the congregations. He maintained,
too, an enormous retinue of vicious Christian parasites, the whole
process worsening the already desperate public burdens, and straining
to the utmost a financial system approaching the point of collapse. As
head of the Church, he presided at Councils; and as a semi-Arian he
encouraged Arianism and persecuted Athanasianism, the orthodox not
daring openly to gainsay him. As little did either party condemn him
when he brutally murdered the young Gallus, the Christian brother of
Julian, leaving only the latter alive of all Constantine&rsquo;s house.
To the bishops assembled in council he announced that his will was as
good as a canon; and he forbade them to condemn opinions which he held.
One bishop he caused to be tortured; others to be banished; one he put
to death; and he would doubtless have slain Athanasius had not that
great agitator been so well concealed by the monks of Egypt. Under the
emperor&rsquo;s pressure the council of Rimini declared for Arianism;
and for himself he framed the new title &ldquo;His Eternity,&rdquo;
calling himself the lord of the universe. Only the favour of the
empress, and the emperor&rsquo;s own fears, saved Julian from his
brother&rsquo;s fate, as his death seems to have been planned.</p>
<p class="par">The Church was worthy of its head. &ldquo;At each
episcopal election or expulsion,&rdquo; says an orthodox writer,
&ldquo;the most exalted sees of Christendom&mdash;Constantinople,
Alexandria, Antioch&mdash;furnished scenes that would have disgraced a
revolution.&rdquo; Julian has told how whole troops of those who were
called heretics were massacred, notably at Cyzicus and at Samosata;
while in Paphlagonia, Bithynia, Galatia, and many other provinces,
towns and villages were utterly destroyed. In one massacre at
Constantinople, the second in connection with the forcible
re-instalment of the semi-Arian bishop Macedonius (342), there perished
more than three thousand people&mdash;considerably more than had
suffered death in the whole ten years of the last pagan persecution.
The orthodox populace, divided in furious factions, fighting like
savages in their very churches, were as brutal as their masters; and no
priesthood was ever more powerless for good than the Christian
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>clergy in face of these horrors. Gregory of
Nazianzun, whose own ferocities of utterance illustrate the character
of the period, declared truly that he had never seen a synod do aught
but worsen a quarrel. Such was Christianity under the first
Christian-bred emperor. And if Tiridates of Armenia (conv. 302) be
taken as the first Christian king, the beginnings of State Christianity
are not greatly improved, since there the new faith was spread by fire
and sword, and the old persecuted unremittingly for a hundred years,
during which time raged many wars of religion between Armenia and
Persia. The new faith had &ldquo;come not to bring peace.&rdquo;</p>

under Julian</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">By common consent, the episode of the short pagan
&ldquo;revival&rdquo; under Julian is the most interesting chapter in
the later history of the Roman Empire proper. The one emperor after
Marcus Aurelius who attracts us as a human being and as a mind, he set
himself a task which, whether he failed or succeeded, must lift his
name high in the annals of a decadent civilization: his failure, in
fact, makes him the most living figure in the long line of autocrats
from Constantine to Charlemagne. It is by such contrast, indeed, that
he becomes eminent. Measured by the standards of progressive
civilizations, against the great minds of the pre-imperial world and
the best statesmen of later realms, he is neither a great ruler nor a
great intelligence. To look for a ruling mind of the highest order in
that environment of decay would be to miss the first and last lesson of
the history of the empire. Supposing a potentially great faculty to be
born in such a society, it could not conceivably grow to efficiency:
the intellectual and the emotional atmosphere forbade. Before there can
be all-round minds there must be all-round men; and the empire had made
an end of the species. Intellectual originality had long disappeared
from a world in which the topmost distinction stood for mere brute
force, cultured men grovelling before it like scourged animals. The
brooding intensity of Lucretius and the large sanity of C&aelig;sar
were become as impossible to men of the Roman name as the life of the
forum of Coriolanus&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href=
"#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>day, or the Greek literature of
the age of Aristophanes. The process of putting a yoke on the world had
duly ended in a world of yoke-bearers, whose best leaders could but
harness them.</p>
<p class="par">Julian, a wistful child, saved from the massacre of his
house, and growing up in a library whose lore there was no man
competent to comment for him, became finally a believer in every
religion save the one which sought to exterminate the rest. Steeped in
theosophies, he was capable of exulting in the disappearance of the
Epicureans, the sanest because the least credulous of the philosophic
sects. Yet the lore he loved, such as it was, had sufficed to make him
or keep him a model of temperance and self-control; chaste and
abstemious while master of the world; just and magnanimous under
provocations which, if he would, he could have met by wholesale
slaughter; caring above all for the inner life while wielding capably
the whole armed power of the State. If we talk of moral success, it
must still be said that Christianity never gave any section of the
Roman Empire a ruler worthy to stand by Marcus and Julian; and that on
all the thrones of the world to-day there is no man who can be put
above them for moral nobility. If, again, we keep our eyes on the age
of Constantine, we cannot but be struck by the fact that Constantius
&ldquo;the pale,&rdquo; the father of Constantine, a monotheist but not
a Christian, and Julian, who turned away from Christianity to
polytheism, are by far the best men in the series of rulers of that
house. Christianity attracted the worse men, Constantine and his sons,
and repelled or failed to satisfy the better; and the younger
Constantius, who was bred and remained a Christian, is the worst of
all. The finer character-values are all associated with paganism: on
the Christian side there is a signal defect of good men.</p>
<p class="par">Julian&rsquo;s short life was crowded no less with
experience than with study. Educated as a Christian, he learned, while
his life lay at the mercy of Constantius, to keep his own counsel as to
the creed of which he had seen such bloody fruits. It seems to have
been before the murder of his brother (354) that he was secretly
converted to paganism, during his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129"
href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>studies at Pergamos. When he
was appointed C&aelig;sar (355) it was under strict tutelage; and
during his five years of able generalship as C&aelig;sar in Gaul and
Germany&mdash;even after the legions had proclaimed him Augustus
(360)&mdash;he concealed his creed. It was only when marching against
Constantius that he avowed it, and offered sacrifices to the ancient
Gods; but when the death of the terror-stricken emperor left him in
sole power (361) he at once proceeded zealously to reinstate the old
rites. Himself an ardent idealist and practical ascetic, he yearned to
make paganism a ministry of purity and charity, which should copy from
the Christians their primary Judaic practice of feeding the poor, and
set its face against popular ribaldry as steadfastly as they once had
done, but with a Stoic temperance rather than a gloomy fanaticism. To
this end he built and endowed new temples, re-endowed the priesthoods
where they had been robbed, and forced the return or repair of such of
their lands, buildings, and possessions as had been stolen or wrecked;
at the same time taking back the privileges and endowments accorded to
the Christians. For all this, and no less for his antipathy to the
vulgar side of paganism, he was scurrilously and insolently lampooned,
notably by the pagan and Christian mobs of Antioch; but he attempted no
vengeance, though he was sensitive enough to reply by satire. The
intensely malignant attacks on his memory by churchmen leave it clear
that he never descended to persecution, unless we so describe his
action in excluding Christians from teaching in the schools of
rhetoric, for which he had at least the pretext that they constantly
aspersed the pagan literature there studied, and ought in consistency
to have left it alone. Some of them indeed had earnestly desired the
total suppression of those very schools. What most exasperated his
Christian assailants, it is clear, was his sardonic attitude to
Christian quarrels. Instead of persecuting, he protected the factions
from each other, restored exiled heretics, and invited rival dogmatists
to dispute in his presence, where their animosities served to humiliate
their creed to his heart&rsquo;s content. It was the sting of such a
memory that drove Gregory of Nazianzun, bitterly conscious of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>Christian hates, to such a passion of hate
against Julian, whose body he would fain have seen cast into the common
sewer.</p>
<p class="par">It has been questioned whether the eagerness of
Julian&rsquo;s desire to discredit Christism would not have made him a
persecutor had he lived longer; and such a development is indeed
conceivable. His zeal was such that with all the load of empire and
generalship on his shoulders he found time in his short reign to write
a long treatise against the Christian books and the creed, of which his
full knowledge and excellent memory made him a formidable critic; and
his tone towards Athanasius seems to have grown more and more bitter.
It is hard for the master of thirty legions to tolerate opposition and
to remain righteous. On the other hand, Julian gave proofs not only of
an abnormal self-restraint, but of an exceptional judgment in things
purely political; and the very fact that his young enthusiasm had led
him astray, making him hope for a vital restoration of paganism out of
hand, would probably with such a mind have counted for caution after
the lesson had been learned. Falling in battle with the Persians (363)
after only twenty months of full power, he had no time to readjust
himself to the forces of things as experience disclosed them to him: he
had time only to feel disappointment. Had he lived to form his own
judgment instead of merely assimilating the ideas of his Neo-Platonic
teachers he would be in a fair way to frame a better philosophy of life
than either the polytheistic or the Christian. Such a philosophy had
been left by Epictetus, to name no other; and Julian&rsquo;s passion
for rites and sacrifices was really a falling below pagan wisdom and
ethics current in his time, as his facile belief in myths was a falling
below the pagan rationalism set forth a little later by Macrobius, and
not unknown in Julian&rsquo;s day. No less unworthy of the best pagan
thought was his affectation of cynic uncleanliness&mdash;an inverted
foppery likely to have passed with youth. A few years must have taught
him that men were not to be regenerated by pagan creeds any more than
by Christian; and to his laws for the reform of administration he might
have added some for the reform of culture. Dying in his prime, he has
formed a text for much Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131"
href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>rhetoric to the effect that
he had dreamed a vain dream. Insofar, however, as that rhetoric assumes
the indestructibility of the Christian Church at the hands of pagan
emperors, it is no sounder than the most sanguine hopes of Julian.</p>
<p class="par">To say that Julian had hopelessly miscalculated the
possibilities of paganism is to misconceive the whole sociological case
if it be implied that Christianity survived in virtue of its dogma or
doctrine, and that it was on the side of dogma or morality that
paganism failed. As a regenerating force Christianity was as impotent
as any pagan creed: it was indeed much less efficacious than one pagan
philosophy had been, and had visibly set up in the State new ferocities
of civil strife. Under the two Antonines, Stoic principles had governed
the empire so well, relatively to the possibilities of the system, that
many modern historians have been fain to reckon theirs the high-water
mark of all European administration. No such level was ever reached in
the Christian empire, from Constantine onwards. Julian himself schemed
more solid reforms of administration in his one year of rule than any
of his Christian successors ever accomplished, with the exceptions of
Marcian and Anastasius; and could he have foreseen how the empire was
to go in Christian hands he would certainly have had no reason to alter
his course. To take the mere actual continuance of Christianity as a
proof of its containing more truth or virtue than the whole of paganism
is to confuse biological survival with moral merit. &ldquo;The survival
of the fittest,&rdquo; a principle which holds good of every aspect of
Nature, is not a formula of moral discrimination, but a simple summary
of evolution. The camel which survives in a waterless desert is not
thereby proved a nobler animal than the horse or elephant which
perishes there. Christianity, as we have seen, while utterly failing
among the Jews, where it had birth, had subsisted from the first in the
pagan world (1) through adopting the attractive features of paganism,
and (2) because of its politico-economical adaptations.
Paganism&mdash;official paganism, that is&mdash;disappeared as an
institution because such adaptations were not given to it.</p>
<p class="par">Nor is it reasonable to say that Julian&rsquo;s
undertaking was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132"
name="pb132">132</a>]</span>impossible. His plans were indeed those of
an inexperienced enthusiast; but had he lived as long as Constantine,
and learned by experience, he might have witnessed his substantial
success; and a century of intelligently continuous policy to the same
end might have expelled Christianity as completely from the Roman world
as Buddhism was soon to be expelled from India. No one who has studied
the latter phenomenon can use the language commonly held of the attempt
of Julian. Buddhism, representing at least as high a moral impetus as
that of Christism, had arisen and nourished greatly in direct
opposition to Brahmanism; after centuries of success it is found
assimilating all the popular superstitions on which Brahmanism lived,
even as Christianity assimilated those of paganism; and it was either
by assimilating elements of Buddhism on that plane or by such policy
joined with coercive force that the Brahmans finally eliminated it from
their sphere. Had a succession of Roman emperors set themselves to
create a priestly organization of pagan cults, with as good an economic
basis as that of Brahmanism, or as that of Judaism was even after the
fall of the Temple, they could have created a force which might triumph
over the new cult in its own sphere even as Brahmanism and Judaism did.
And if at the same time they had left the Church severely alone,
allowing its perpetual strifes to do their own work, it would
inevitably have dissolved itself by sheer fission into a hundred
mutually menacing factions, an easy foe for a coherent paganism. Mere
spasmodic persecution had previously failed, for it is not random
persecution that kills creeds, though a really relentless and enduring
persecution can do much. In the period from 330 to 370, and again in
the sixth century, the Persian kings did actually, by sheer bloodshed,
so far crush orthodox Christianity in their kingdom (leaving only the
Nestorians as anti-Byzantine heretics) that it ceased to have any
importance there&mdash;a circumstance little noted by those who dwell
on its &ldquo;success&rdquo; in Europe. And the same Sassanide dynasty,
beginning in the middle of the third century, effected the systematic
revival of the Mazdean religion, which before had seemed corrupted and
discredited past remedy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Had Julian lived to learn in Persia the methods so
successfully used by Ardeshir, he might no less successfully have
copied them. Only an idealist like Julian, of course, would have
thought the effort on peaceful lines worth while. A much abler and
better man than Jovian would reasonably decide in his place that the
religion of Mithra, having come from the now triumphant Persian enemy,
could hardly continue to be that of the Roman army; and that the most
politic course was to revert to the cult which Julian had opposed, and
whose champions saw in his death the hand of their God working for
them. Nonetheless, the common verdict on Julian as the victim of a
hopeless delusion is hardly better founded than the gross fable that on
receiving his death-wound he cried, &ldquo;Thou hast conquered,
Galilean.&rdquo; The Christians, indeed, might well exult and fabulize
over his death. It probably made all the difference between prosperity
and collapse for their creed, already riven in irreconcilable factions,
and capable of a general cohesion only through the coercive power of
the State.</p>

<i>Re-establishment: Disestablishment of Paganism</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is significant that neither the weak Jovian,
thrust on the throne by a cabal of Christian officers at the death of
Julian, nor the forceful Valentinian who succeeded him, attempted to
persecute paganism, though both were professed Christians. In the
assertions of the ecclesiastical historians to the contrary, in the
next century, the wish was father to the thought. Jovian&rsquo;s
ignominious retreat from Persia was made after open pagan auguries; the
nominally Christian senate of Constantinople sent him a deputation
headed by the pagan Themistius, who exhorted him on high grounds of
pagan ethics to practise an absolute toleration; and he did, save as
regards the continued crusade against secret magical rites, though he
re-established the Christians in many of their privileges. Of
Valentinian it has been said that he of all the Christian emperors best
understood and maintained freedom of worship; and beyond confiscating
to the imperial domain the possessions formerly taken from pagan
temples and restored to them by Julian, he left them unmolested. Pagan
priests of the higher <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>grades he treated with greater
fiscal favour than had been shown to them even by Julian, giving them
immunities and honours which exasperated the Christians. It may have
been the fact of his ruling the still strongly pagan West that made
Valentinian thus propitiate the old priesthoods; but his brother
Valens, who ruled the East, enforced the same tolerance, save insofar
as he, an Arian, persecuted the Athanasians. His forcing of monks to
re-enter the <i>curia</i>, that is, to resume the burdens of municipal
taxation, may have been motived by dislike of them, but was a
reasonable fiscal measure. The cruel persecution of diviners, carried
on by both brothers, was the outcome at once of fear and of anger at
the rapid spread of divination, to which was devoted at that time an
extensive literature: the public or official Roman divination by augury
was expressly permitted, as were the Eleusinian mysteries. All the
while, Christians were little less given to divination than pagans.</p>
<p class="par">Thus in the thirty years from the death of Constantine
to the accession of Theodosius the Great, while the Church continued to
grow in wealth, it can have made little progress politically, and it
certainly made none morally. The law of Valentinian against the
gain-seeking monks and priests of Rome is the testimony of a Christian
emperor to the new demoralization set up by his Church. Perhaps on
pagan pressure, but apparently with emphasis, he forbade ecclesiastics
to receive personal gifts or legacies from the women of property to
whom they acted as spiritual advisers. Such a law was of course evaded
by such expedients as trusteeships: greed was not to be baulked by
legal vetoes. The higher clergy showed the same instincts; and in the
final struggle of Damasus and Ursinus to secure by physical force the
episcopal chair of Rome (366), one hundred and thirty-seven dead bodies
were counted in the basilica, Damasus having hired gladiators to carry
his point. In the provinces, doubtless, the church was often better
represented; and the new species of <i>chorepiscopi</i> or rural
bishops must have included some estimable men; but at all the great
Christian centres reigned violence, greed, and hate. In North Africa
the feud between the Donatists and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135"
href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>the rest of the Church had
reached the form of a chronic civil war, in which Donatist peasant
fanatics, called Circumcelliones, met the official persecution by
guerilla warfare of the savagest sort. In the East, the furious strifes
between Arians and Athanasians were sufficient to discredit the entire
Church as a political factor; and the better pagans saw in it a much
worse ethical failure than could be charged on their own philosophies.
&ldquo;Make me bishop of Rome,&rdquo; said the pagan prefect
Praetextatus jestingly to Damasus, &ldquo;and I will be a
Christian.&rdquo; What rational element lay in Arianism was
countervailed by the corruption set up by court favour; and orthodoxy
found its account in popular ignorance. One of the last notably
philosophic heretics was Photinus, bishop of Sirmium, who in 343
revived the doctrine of a &ldquo;modal&rdquo; Trinity. Anathematized
and ostracized by Athanasians and Arians alike, he died in exile.</p>
<p class="par">The accession (379) of Theodosius, made co-emperor by
Gratian, son of Valentinian, on the fall of Valens, marks the final
establishment of Trinitarian Christianity, with the official
suppression of Arianism and paganism. The young Gratian had been partly
educated under Bishop Ambrose of Milan, one of the first notable types
of masterful ecclesiastic; and under that influence he confiscated the
lands of the pagan temples in the West, withdrew the privileges of the
priests, and caused to be removed from the Senate at Rome the ancient
and sacred statue of the Goddess Victory, formerly removed by
Constantius and restored by Julian. Fiscal needs seem to have had much
to do with the confiscations, for the economic life of the western
empire was steadily sinking. The young emperor did not attempt to
prohibit pagan worship or abolish the right of the temples to receive
legacies; and though he is said to have refused the title of Pontifex
Maximus it seems to have been officially given to him. His anti-pagan
policy, however, seems to have counted for something in his
unpopularity, which became so great that when Maximus revolted in
Britain and invaded Gaul, Gratian was abandoned on all hands.</p>
<p class="par">Maximus too was a Christian&mdash;another proof that
since Constantine many military men had come to think &ldquo;the luck
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>was changed&rdquo;&mdash;and though he
conciliated the pagans he did not re-endow their cults. It was under
his auspices, too, that Priscillian, bishop of Avila, in Spain, who had
adopted Gnostic views closely resembling those of the Manich&aelig;ans,
and had been banished under Gratian, was tried in Gaul for his heresy,
put to the torture, and executed at Treves with several of his
followers. A new step had thus been taken in the process of
establishment, so that when Theodosius overthrew Maximus and left the
empire of the West to the young Valentinian, the cause of official
paganism was much weakened. And when Valentinian in turn was deposed
and slain by the pagan party, though Ambrose confessedly thought the
Christian cause in the West was lost, Eugenius did not venture to
restore to the priesthoods the possessions and revenues which had been
turned to the support of the decaying State, menaced all along the
north by a hungry barbarism that grew ever more conscious of its power,
and of the impotence of the imperial colossus.</p>
<p class="par">When Eugenius and his party in turn fell before
Theodosius, the cause of State-paganism was visibly lost; and though
Theodosius died in the following year (395) he left the old cults
finally disestablished in Italy as well as in the East. In his reign of
sixteen years in the East he had as far as possible suppressed
Arianism, depriving the Arians of their churches; had caused or
permitted many of the already disendowed pagan temples to be robbed and
dismantled; and had prohibited all pagan worships, besides continuing
the crusade against divination. Under the shelter of such persecuting
edicts, monks and other enterprising Christians, calling themselves
&ldquo;reformers,&rdquo; were at liberty everywhere to plunder or
destroy the shrines, and even to secure the lands of pagans on the
pretence that they had defied the law and offered sacrifices. So gross
became the demoralization that Theodosius, more scrupulous than the
clergy, at length passed a law to punish the Christian spoilers; but
this could not save the pagans. Many of them, to save themselves,
affected conversion, and went to Christian altars to do inward
reverence to their old Gods. There can have been no worthy process of
moral suasion in such circumstances. Coercion, applauded by Augustine
and personally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>practised by such Christian leaders as St.
Martin of Tours, became the normal procedure; and naturally the
constrained converts brought with them into the Church all the
credences of their previous life. For the Church, such a triumph was
glory enough, especially when there was added to it a law by which all
Christian offenders, clerical or lay, were amenable to trial and
punishable before ecclesiastical tribunals only.</p>
<p class="par">It does not appear that the many cruel laws of
Theodosius against heretics and pagans were carried out to the letter:
it had sufficed for the overthrow of official paganism that it should
be cut off from its financial basis; and the emperor not only tolerated
but employed professed pagans, being even willing to grant to those of
Rome concessions which Ambrose could not endure. On their part the
pagans, though still very numerous, were non-resistant. Broadly
speaking, they consisted of two sorts&mdash;the more or less
philosophic few, who were for the most part monotheists, inclined to
see in all Gods mere symbols of the central power of the universe; and
the unphilosophic multitude, high and low, who believed by habit, and
whose spiritual needs were on the ordinary Christian plane. The former
sort were not likely to battle for the old machinery of sacrifice and
invocation; and the latter, with none to lead them, were not hard to
turn, when once new habits had time to grow. Whoever gave them a
liturgy and rites and sacraments, with shrines and places of adoration,
might count on satisfying their religious yearnings; and this the
Christian organization was zealously bent on doing. Their festivals
were preserved and adapted; their local &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; had become
Christian martyrs and patron saints; their mysteries were duplicated;
their holy places were but new-named; their cruder ideals were
embraced. In the way of ceremonial, as Mosheim avows, there was
&ldquo;little difference in those times between the public worship of
the Christians and that of the Greeks and Romans.&rdquo; The
<i>lituus</i> of the augur had become the crozier of the bishop; the
mitres and tiaras of the heathen priests were duly transferred to the
new hierarchy; and their processions were as nearly as possible copies
of those of the great ceremonial cults of Egypt and the East.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">A sample of the process of adaptation lies in the
ecclesiastical calendar, where in the month of October are (or were)
commemorated on three successive days Saint Bacchus, Saint Demetrius,
and Saints Dionysius, Rusticus, and Eleutherius, all described as
martyrs. The five names are simply those of the God Dionysos, whose
rustic festival was held at that season. In the same way, Osiris
becomes St. Onuphrius, from his Coptic name, Onufri. It is probable,
again, that from the year 376, when the shrine of Mithra at Rome was
destroyed by Christian violence, the Roman Pope, who succeeded the high
priest of Mithra at the Vatican mount, sat in the Mithraic sacred
chair, preserved in St. Peter&rsquo;s to this day. As representing
Peter, he bore Mithra&rsquo;s special symbols. And where the higher
paganism had come to repudiate the popular religion of trappings and
ceremonial no less than that of sacrifice and that of mere
self-mortification, established Christianity placed the essence of
religion anew in external usages on the one hand and asceticism on the
other; cherishing the while every &ldquo;superstition&rdquo; of the
past, and beginning a species of image-worship that the past had hardly
known. What was overthrown was merely public or official worship: the
religious essentials of paganism&mdash;to wit, polytheism; the belief
in the intercession of subordinate spiritual powers; the principles of
sacrifice and propitiation, penance, and atonement; the special
adoration of local shrines and images; the practice of ritual mysteries
and imposing ceremonies; the public association of a worship with the
fortunes of the State&mdash;all these were preserved in the Catholic
Church, with only the names changed. There was no &ldquo;destruction of
paganism,&rdquo; there was merely transformation. And so immeasurably
slow are the transformations of national habit that for many
generations even the terminology and the specific usages of paganism
survived in every aspect save that of open worship; so that Theodosius
and his sons were fain to pass law after law penalizing those who
ventured to revert from Christianity to paganism. Such reversions were
the measure of the moral as compared with the official success of
Christianity.</p>
<p class="par">The last act in the official crusade against paganism,
open <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>spoliation, had become possible at length
through the sheer decadence of character in the empire. In the west,
so-called Romans had lived on a tradition of ancient rule till they
were become as masquerading apes in the light of the retrospect: all
that was left of patrician semblance was a faculty for declamation,
pedantry, and pomp. The repeated discussions over the removal of the
statue of Victory were on the senatorial side a tissue of artificial
rhetoric, on the Christian a mixture of frank bigotry and bad
sophistry. Religious fanaticism, the last and lowest form of moral
energy, abounded only with the mob; and the formless pagan crowd, never
in touch with priests or senators, and never conscious of a common
centre, was useless for political purposes when at length the upper
class had need of it; while the much smaller Christian mob, drilled and
incited to a common fervour, was a force formidable even to the
autocrat. Patricians whose line had for centuries cringed in all things
political were not the men to lose their lives for a ceremonial; and
those of them who as priests had been plundered by Gratian and
Theodosius were on this side also devoid of organization, and incapable
of joint action. The rule of Valentinian had forced the Christian
Church to remain in touch with its original and popular sources of
revenue; whereas the pagan priesthoods, once deprived of stipends and
domains, had nowhere to turn to, and may be said to have fallen without
a blow, unless the deposition of Valentinian II by Arbogastes, and the
short usurpation of Eugenius, be regarded as their last official effort
to survive.</p>
<p class="par">But the cause of empire in the West was no less moribund
than that of the ancient Gods. Italy was reaching the last stage of
economic and military depletion. The richest revenue-yielding provinces
of the empire lay in Africa and the East; and when there came the fatal
struggle with barbarism, the eastern and richer part of the empire, so
long wont to act independently of the western, let that succumb. It was
at least dramatically fit that the multiform and fortuitous contexture
of Roman paganism, evolved like the empire itself by a long series of
instinctive acts and adaptations, unruled by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>any
higher wisdom, should yield up its official form and sustenance to feed
the dying body politic, and should be expunged from the face of the
State before that was overthrown. Augustine might say what he would to
the reproachful pagans, but the last humiliation came under Christian
auspices; and the fanatical Jerome, type of the transformation of Roman
energy from action to private pietism, had to weep in his old age that
his cult could not save the immemorial city whose very name had so long
ruled the world, and was almost the last semblance of a great thing
left in it.</p>
<p class="par">It consisted with the universal intellectual decadence
that neither the pagans nor the Christians realized the nature of
either the religious or the political evolution. The former regarded
the new faith as a blasphemy which had brought on the empire the
ruinous wrath of the Gods; the latter called the barbaric invasion a
divine punishment both of pagan and Christian wickedness, and saw in
the decline of all pagan worship the defeat of a false faith by a true.
Neither had the slightest perception of the real and human causation;
the degradation of the peoples by the yoke of Rome; the economic ruin
and moral paralysis of Rome by sheer empire: and as little could they
realize that the fortunes of the creeds were natural socio-political
sequences. What had ecclesiastically happened was essentially an
economic process, albeit one set up by a religious credence. Paganism
as a public system disappeared because it was deprived of all its
revenues; Christianity as a system finally flourished because the
church was legally empowered to receive donations and legacies without
limit, and debarred from parting with any of its property. Any
corporation whatever, any creed whatever, would have flourished on such
a basis; while only a priesthood capable of building up a voluntary
revenue as the Christian church had originally done could survive on
pagan lines after the Christian creed had been established. The pagan
priesthoods, originally generated on a totally different footing, could
not learn the economic lesson, could not readjust themselves to a
process which, as we have seen, originated in conditions of fanatical
nonconformity, which latter-day <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141"
href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>paganism could not reproduce.
But so far were the mental habitudes and the specific beliefs of
paganism from disappearing that Christian historians in our own day
bitterly denounce it for &ldquo;infecting&rdquo; their
&ldquo;revealed&rdquo; creed, which in the terms of their claim was
divinely designed to overthrow paganism, and which would assuredly have
rent itself into a medley of reciprocally anathematizing sects but for
the unifying coercion of the State. What had really died out on the
&ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; side was the primitive ideal of the Christian
Church. What survived as Christianity was really an idolatrous
polytheism. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=

of Arianism</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Theodosius was the last ruler of the empire proper
who was capable of leading his army; and from his death onwards the
fall of the western section proceeded at headlong rate. His sons,
Honorius and Arcadius, were worse weaklings than even the sons of
Valentinian: to fit for the throne a child born in the purple, always a
hard task, seemed impossible under Christianity. At the end of the
fourth century begins the series of convulsions which mark the end of
the Roman empire properly so-called. In the year after
Theodosius&rsquo; death, Alaric invaded and ravaged Greece; and,
man&oelig;uvred thence by Stilicho, proceeded to invade Italy. The
tentative character of these unsuccessful first attempts, and of that
of Rhadagast, only made more sure the triumph of the later; and
invasion followed on invasion, till by the middle of the fifth century
the West had lost Gaul, Spain, and Africa; and in the year 476 Rome,
thrice sacked, received at last a barbarian king.</p>
<p class="par">Through all these storms Christianity as a whole more
than held its ground. The invaders were Christians, like the invaded,
albeit heretics; the first conversion of Goths by the Arian Ulphilas in
the previous century having been widely extended. The form of the dogma
mattered nothing to the political function of the church, which was,
among the barbarians as in the empire, to promote centralization up to
the point at which schism became ungovernable. The Teutonic chieftains,
it is clear, saw in the Christian Church a means of partially welding
their peoples somewhat as Rome had been welded; and while Arianism held
the ground among them, it furthered the unity that in the eastern
empire was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>now being lost. And inasmuch as normal community
of creed made possible an assimilation between the invaders and the
conquered, Christianity positively facilitated the fall of the western
empire. In Africa, again, where the Donatists, with their four hundred
bishops, had been freshly persecuted under Honorius, the schism helped
the invading Vandals, who paid for the Donatists&rsquo; help by giving
them freedom of worship. It is probable that the Manich&aelig;ans, who
were numerous in the same province, and who were also much persecuted,
at first welcomed the invaders. So obvious was the risk of such
alienations of heretics that Honorius, listening for a moment to the
advice of tolerant pagans, went so far as to issue a law of general
toleration. This, however, the orthodox clergy forced him to repeal,
and the persecution of Donatists went from bad to worse. All the while
the old paganism was still so common in the West that Honorius, who on
the advice of his pious minister Olympius, after the fall of Stilicho,
had sought to expel by edict all pagans and Arians from the service of
the State, was fain later to entreat leading pagans to return. But the
Arian Goths in turn showed the pagans no favour; in Greece, Alaric even
broke up the Eleusinian mysteries; and the Vandals in Africa soon
persecuted the Manich&aelig;ans even more bloodily than they did the
Athanasians, whom they went far to drive out of the province. In this
way they in turn weakened their State, besides otherwise undergoing the
social diseases of empire, so that in the sixth century Belisarius was
able to reconquer it for Justinian, the emperor of the East. In Spain,
conquered by the Arian Visigoths, there was relative toleration. The
Arian clergy, however, being mostly unlettered Teutons, were less
useful instruments to the ruler than Catholics could be; and late in
the sixth century a new king at his accession there adopted
Trinitarianism.</p>
<p class="par">The further the orthodox faith went, the more dangerous,
it was clear, was the position of the remaining Arian kingdoms, since
their heresy was always a pretext for a union of the others to crush
them. A barbarian king, told by his clergy that he did God service in
destroying heretics, needed little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144"
href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>further encouragement to war;
and such counsel the orthodox Church was always ready to give. Already
at the end of the fifth century the immigrant Franks established in
Gaul under Clovis were &ldquo;converted&rdquo; in mass, by the mere
fiat of their king, to orthodox Christianity; and the reconquest of
Italy by Belisarius and Narses further strengthened the Catholic cause.
It was thus good policy for the Lombards, who in their turn conquered
the north and south but never the centre of Italy, to begin to give up
their Arianism at the end of the century. It is probable, however, that
in any case Arianism would in course of time have fallen in the new
barbaric States as it did in the eastern empire. The toleration given
by Theodoric in Italy, and by the earlier Arian Goths in Spain and
Gaul, to the Catholic creed, could avail nothing to stay the orthodox
purpose of destroying heresy; and the element of rationalism on the
Arian side was precisely what could least prosper in an era of
ignorance. Thus the Catholic creed had time and credulity on its side;
and, Christianity at that stage being above all things politically
useful as an aid to arbitrary government, the most pronounced and
sacerdotal and superstitious form of Christianity must be the most
useful from a calculating monarch&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p class="par">Such, broadly, was the development in the East, where
the virtual suppression or expulsion of Arianism by Theodosius and his
successors showed what persistent persecution could do when carried on
by both penal and economic means, through a hierarchy who knew how and
where to strike, and had their hearts in the work. Arianism was not
destroyed; indeed all of the great heresies of the first five
centuries&mdash;Marcionism, Montanism, Arianism, Manich&aelig;ism,
Monophysitism, to say nothing of the Nestorian Church in Asia&mdash;are
found subsisting in the eastern empire in the seventh century, despite
both disendowment and cruel persecution, thus in effect proving that
had Christianity been simply left alone, neither helped nor attacked by
the State, it would have been dissolved in a score of warring sects by
the fifth century. The Manich&aelig;ans were as inflexible as ever were
any of the Christists; and as against the convictions of the heretics
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>general the moral failure of the orthodox Church
was absolute. By executing Priscillian in the fourth century it simply
inflamed his following, which was strong in Spain two hundred years
later. But though the endowed clergy could not convert or exterminate
the others, they could keep them poor and ostracized, and wield against
them the subsidized mob as well as the whole machinery of the State.
Against such oppression the heretics could not compete as the early
Jesuists had done against the careless course of paganism, with its
isolated priests, so much more often indifferent than fanatical.</p>
<p class="par">Where early Christism had met the cravings alike of
ascetics, of mystics, of simple emotionalists, and of poor seekers
after a concrete God not hedged around with altars and priests, thus
appealing both to heretic Jews and to heretic Gentiles, the later
heresies ostensibly appealed as a rule either to ascetics or to
dogmatists, and offered nothing to the multitude that it could not find
within the Church, shades of dogma apart. Manich&aelig;ism indeed
remained to prove that what was virtually a new religion could rise and
persist for centuries in the teeth of Christianity, by methods and
appeals very like those of Christism; but it also served to prove that
organized and endowed and established Christianity, inspired by an
enduring hate, could check and overshadow the rival religion where
unorganized paganism, for lack of general animus and systematic
official zeal, had failed to subdue Christianity. And the political
elimination of nominal Arianism in the West served to prove afresh that
orthodoxy finally triumphed in that regard by enlisting on its side not
only the instincts of polytheism but the interests of monarchy. It is
significant that, driven from the empire, Arianism flourished best in
the barbarian world, where for a time some mental freedom might be
supposed to subsist. If any rational motive is to be assigned for the
zealous adoption of the Athanasian creed by such rulers as Theodosius,
it is presumably their perception that the most irrational dogma went
best with discipline: that the spirit which presumed to rationalize
religion was the less ready for political obedience. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>On
the other hand, the Trinitarian clergy of Spain found their advantage
as a hierarchy by bringing round their Arian masters to the orthodox
creed. In any case, the triumph of orthodoxy went step for step not
only with intellectual dissolution and moral paralysis, but with the
disruption of the empire.</p>

Orthodoxy</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The constant law of theological development was
that all stirrings of reason were anathematized as heresy, and that
dogmas became orthodox in the ratio of their extravagance. Paganizing
and polytheistic heresy such as that of the Collyridians of Arabia (4th
c.), who worshipped Mary as a Goddess and offered her cakes
(<i>collyrid&aelig;</i>) as their mothers had done to Ashtaroth, ran
little risk: their heresy in fact was on the way to be orthodoxy. Saner
heresies fared differently. Late in the fourth century we find the
Italian monk Jovinian opposing asceticism, urging a rational morality,
and explaining that Mary ceased to be a virgin on bringing forth Jesus;
for which offences he was condemned in Church Councils, flogged, and
banished to a desolate island. A little later, Vigilantius, a presbyter
from Gaul, ventured to oppose the growing worship of relics, prayers to
saints, the use of sacred tapers, vigils, and pilgrimages, as well as
to decry many current miracles. So furious was the outcry of Jerome in
his case that he had to hold his peace if he would save his life. No
leading churchman said a word for either reformer: Ambrose and Jerome
both condemned Jovinian; and the language of Jerome against Vigilantius
is a revelation of the new possibilities of intellectual malice created
by creed. On this side, human nature had reverted several degrees to
Hebraism.</p>
<p class="par">Later still, the heresy of Pelagius, also a western,
aroused a bitter orthodox opposition, led by Augustine. Pelagius (a
name probably the Grecized form of the British name Morgan) and
C&oelig;lestius, an Irishman, both monks in Rome about the years
400&ndash;410, drew up a systematic argument against the doctrines of
human depravity, predestination, and salvation by grace; denied the
damnation of unbaptized infants and virtuous unbaptized adults;
rejected the Biblical teaching that Adam <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>died in consequence
of his sin or entailed sin on posterity; and taught a relatively
rational ethic. Flying from Rome on Alaric&rsquo;s invasion, they went,
C&oelig;lestius to Carthage and Pelagius to the East; the former to be
condemned by a Council at Carthage (412), the latter to be for a time
supported against attacks, but later to be condemned likewise.
Henceforth the half-suppressed vestiges of Pelagianism (chiefly in the
hesitating form of semi-Pelagianism, according to which God
foreordained good but merely foreknew evil) were the only signs left in
the West, apart from Arianism, of the spirit of critical reason, till
the first stirrings of the medieval renascence.</p>
<p class="par">In the West, it will be observed, spontaneous heresy had
run to questions of action and ethics, partly following a Roman
tradition of concern for conduct, partly expressing barbarian
common-sense. To such thought, Christianity was alien, and it was cried
down by voluble theologians like Augustine, backed, doubtless, not only
by the average obedient priest, but by some who saw that the principles
of Pelagius, logically carried out, made an end on the one hand of the
whole Christian scheme, and on the other of the conception of an
omnipotent God. Such reasoners must equally have seen that the
Augustinian dogmas of predestination and grace made an end of human
responsibility; and this was urged by some Pelagians, but with no
effect. The irrational dogma best consisted with the functions and
finance of the church, and it was ecclesiastically established
accordingly.</p>
<p class="par">In the East, though there also Pelagius found followers,
spontaneous heresy, as we have seen, was usually a matter of abstract
dogma, as in the schisms of Praxeas, Sabellius, Paul of Samosata,
Arius, and the Gnostics. What critical thought there was continued to
follow the lead given to it by the older Greek dialectics. A&euml;rius,
who raised in Asia Minor in the fourth century an agitation against
episcopacy, fasts, prayers for the dead, and the ceremony of slaying a
lamb at Easter, is an exception among eastern heretics; and the
dogmatic-dialectic tendency persisted. In the fifth century, Theodorus
of Mopsuestia, a voluminous writer, taught rationally that most of the
Old Testament prophecies applied by orthodoxy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>to
Jesus had reference to events in pre-Christian history. Needless to
say, this was heresy. But the chief new schisms of the period were
those of Nestorius and the Monophysites. Nestorius, Bishop of
Constantinople, a pupil of Theodorus, but a zealous persecutor of
heresy, became embroiled in the second stage of the endless wrangle as
to the nature of Christ. In the latter half of the fourth century,
Apollinaris, Bishop of Laodicea, a strong anti-Arian, holding that the
dogma of a God-Man was monstrous, had taught that Jesus was without a
human soul (or mind, as distinguished from mere animal life), having
only a divine one. This was to &ldquo;confound the two natures&rdquo;;
Apollinaris was condemned; and the Syrian orthodox rectified matters by
insisting that there <i>were</i> two, while the Egyptians, recoiling
from the risk of a theory of two Christs, insisted that the two were
nevertheless one.</p>
<p class="par">Nestorius stood with his fellow-Syrians, and sought to
crush the Apollinarians as he had helped to hound down Arians,
Novatians, and other misbelievers. The Apollinarians, however, had a
stronghold in their deification of Mary, whom they called
<i>Theotokos</i> or <i>Deipara</i>, &ldquo;the mother (bearer) of
God&rdquo;; and when the Nestorians denounced the common use of this
term they incurred the wrath of the multitude, who, wont in the past to
worship Goddess-mothers with a special devotion, and wroth at the
attempt to put Mary lower than Isis and Cybel&ecirc;, naturally sought
to exalt Mary as they had exalted Jesus. A general Council (431) was
called at Ephesus to denounce Nestorius; and he, the heresy-hunter, was
convicted of blasphemy, classed with Judas, and banished for life.
Thenceforth, orthodox Christianity was for all practical purposes a
worship of a Goddess and two supreme Gods; and Nestorian Christianity,
flourishing in Asia, where its adherents were known by the old label of
&ldquo;Nazar&aelig;ans,&rdquo; became a hostile religion. Thus in the
East as in the West the State was riven in new religious factions at
the very hour when it needed above all things unity. Persia was at that
very time beginning the acquisition of half of Armenia, as the Vandals
were beginning the conquest of North Africa. To Persia the Nestorians
were driven; and there, declaring themselves the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>friends of the enemies of the Byzantine empire,
they were fostered, while the orthodox Christians were persecuted,
massacred, and expelled.</p>
<p class="par">To a thoughtful pagan, viewing the course of things, it
must have seemed as if the Gods had given over the Christians to
madness. Among the chief enemies of Nestorius was Eutyches, an abbot of
a Constantinople monastery. In the year 448, by way of making an end of
Nestorianism, he explicitly taught that Christ had only one nature, the
divine. Instantly this was in turn denounced as a return to the
Apollinarian heresy, and Eutyches was cast out of the church by a
hostile council. Another council, skilfully packed, acquitted him, and
caused his accuser to be flogged and banished; but a third, that of
Chalcedon (451), again condemned him. Thus was the Christian dogma
fixed in the form of maximum arbitrariness and unintelligibility. The
Council of Nic&aelig;a (321) had determined against Arius that Christ
was truly God, co-equal and co-eternal with his Father, separate and
yet one; the Council of Constantinople (381) had determined against
Apollinaris that he was also truly man; that of Ephesus (431) had
established that the two natures were indivisibly one; and that of
Chalcedon (451) that they were nevertheless perfectly distinct. All
four dogmas became fixed constituents of the Christian creed. To this
length had men evolved a myth. And there were still developments to
come.</p>
<p class="par">The condemned Eutycheans, modifying their position, but
still calling themselves Monophysites, became in turn a force of fatal
cleavage. The emperor Zeno, in the year 482, conciliated them by an
edict called his Henoticon (&ldquo;unifying&rdquo;); but the orthodox
only opposed them the more; though all the while the Monophysites
professed to regard the &ldquo;one nature&rdquo; as a union of two,
&ldquo;yet without any conversion, confusion, or commixture.&rdquo; On
this absolutely unintelligible difference the sects finally sundered
their very nationality. Late in the sixth century, under a new leader,
Jacobus Barad&aelig;us, they became known as Jacobites; and when in the
next century the rising movement of the Mohammedan Arabs broke upon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>Egypt, where they abounded, the hatred of
Jacobites for Catholics was such as to make them welcome the
anti-Christian enemy, as they and others had previously welcomed the
Persians in Syria.</p>
<p class="par">It is not to be supposed, indeed, that the creed of
Christianity was the sole or primary cause of such a miserable
evolution. The very insanity of the strifes of Christians over
meaningless dogmas is primarily to be traced to the fatal constriction
of life and energy represented by the imperial system. It was because
men had no rational interests to strive over if they would that they
strove insanely over abracadabras of creed, and made war flags of the
two colours of the charioteers of the circus; even as in Egypt the
abject populations of the old cities, down to the time of Julian,
fought to the death for their respective animal-Gods. But it is
essential to note the absolute failure of Christianity to give to the
decaying civilization any light for its path. It flourished by reason
of decadence, and it could not arrest it. What ultimately preserved any
section of the Christian empire was the pagan heritage of law and
system, applied to a State shorn of all its outlying and alien
provinces, and reduced to the homogeneity and the status of a kingdom
proper with a commercial and industrial life. Justinian was fain to set
a non-Christian lawyer&mdash;Tribonian, a pagan or atheist&mdash;to
frame the code of laws by which Byzantium went on living. Himself we
find fulminating against revived heresies, anathematizing the long-dead
Origen, and latterly enouncing heresies of his own which, had he lived
longer, would have wrought fresh convulsions in the State.</p>
<p class="par">Such is the note of Greek-Christian life down to the
very hour of the supreme catastrophe which tore from the warlike
Heraclius the provinces of Syria and Egypt (632&ndash;639), and,
engulfing next North Africa, overthrew Christianity forever in the
lands in which it had been built up. Heraclius, struggling to save a
shaken empire, had early realized, as did Maurice before him, the
madness of driving myriads of Nestorians into the arms of Persia; and
after his triumph over Chosroes he sought to conciliate both Nestorians
and Monophysites by a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=
"#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>decree (630) to the effect that,
while there were in Christ two natures, there was only one will, as was
admitted by the Nestorians. For a time all seemed well, and many
Monophysites in the outlying provinces returned to the Church. But in a
few years an orthodox zealot, Sophronius, patriarch of Jerusalem,
reopened the eternal debate, and declared that the new formula was a
revival of the Eutychean heresy. In vain Heraclius, striving to save
the remnants of the empire, sought to enforce his solution (639) by an
<i>ecthesis</i>, or formula, which forbade further debate on the
subject. The Catholics decided that there were two wills, though they
always coincided; and the doctrine of one will&mdash;the
&ldquo;Monothelite&rdquo; heresy&mdash;at length became a ground for
the repudiation of the rule of Constans II over Italy, a hundred
bishops anathematizing the <i>typus</i> or formula in which he endorsed
the <i>ecthesis</i> of his grandfather. Finally, Constantine II (681)
accepted the doctrine that in Christ two wills were harmonized, and one
more orthodox countersense was added to the definition of the God-Man
who never was. The so-called Athanasian creed&mdash;really a product of
the Latin Church some centuries later than Athanasius&mdash;is a parade
of the whole series. To this much had Christianity attained after four
hundred years of indescribable strife. The one clue through the chaos
is the perception that in every stage the dispute logically went back
to the original issue of monotheism and polytheism. The church, holding
by the Hebrew sacred books as well as its own, was committed
doctrinally to the former, but practically to the latter. Every
affirmation of &ldquo;one&rdquo; tended to imperil the separate
divinity of the sacrificed Jesus; and every affirmation of duality gave
an opening to the polytheists. The one durable solution was, at each
crisis, to make both affirmations, and so baffle at once reason and
schismatic fanaticism.</p>
<p class="par">In effect, Christianity had become polytheistic; and
were it not that the personalities of Father<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2690" title="Not in source">,</span> Mother and Son satisfied the
average religious need, as it had so long done in pre-Christian Egypt,
the dispute actually begun by Bishop Macedonius of Constantinople in
the fourth century over the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href=
"#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>modality of the Holy Ghost would
have gone as far as those over the Son and &ldquo;the Mother of
God.&rdquo; In its first stage, the conception of the Holy Spirit, so
vague and purposeless in the orthodox doctrine, would seem to have been
distinctly that of a feminine Deity. We know from Origen that in the
lost gospel of the Hebrews Jesus was made to speak of &ldquo;My Mother
the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This was a heretical reversion, on
Jud&aelig;o-Gnostic lines, to the original Semitic theosophy, according
to which every God had his female counterpart; but ordinary Jewish
monotheism, which had put aside the female Spirit (<i>Ruach</i>) of its
older lore, was sufficiently strong to prevent the acceptance of such a
heresy in the gospel-making period; and the accepted gospel birth-myth
was better adapted to the general purposes of the cult. For the
paganized Church, finally, the divinization of Mary was a simple
matter, as we have seen; and the Holy Spirit, which had obscurely
entered the orthodox myth in a form really Samaritan, but permitted by
Judaic doctrine, thenceforth remained a gratuitous enigma, capping the
mystery of the co-eternal Father and Begotten Son. The Eastern Church,
recoiling from a reiteration of the latter countersense, decided (381)
that the Spirit &ldquo;proceeded from&rdquo; the Father, but not from
the Son, thus virtually depriving the Son, after all, of his so-often
affirmed equality.</p>
<p class="par">The root of the difficulty, as of the Trinitarian dogma
in general, is to be seen in the old Egyptian pantheism, according to
which the all-comprehending Amun &ldquo;is at once the Father, the
Mother, and the Son of God&rdquo;; but even as the Amunite priests made
play with the Son-God Khonsu after affirming the oneness of Amun, so
the Christian priesthood was forced at every step to distinguish the
Son while affirming the oneness of the Trinity; and each new dogma was
a fresh ground for the old quarrel. In the end the Western Church
rejected this Eastern heresy as it did the Monothelite; and the Council
of Toledo (589) added to the creed the <i>Filioque</i> clause, thus
stating that the Spirit proceeded from the Father &ldquo;and from the
Son.&rdquo; But at this point the Eastern Church remained obstinate; it
admitted that the Spirit came through <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>the Son, but would
not say it &ldquo;proceeded from&rdquo; the Son; and the
<i>Filioque</i> clause remained a standing ground of feud between East
and West, as well as a standing instance of the irrationality of the
orthodox system. It is no wonder that in the seventh century eastern
churchmen were still writing treatises against paganism, which, despite
all the penal laws, persisted in virtue of its incoherent simplicity as
against the systematic unintelligibility of the Christian creed.</p>
<p class="par">A politic Christian, indeed, might point to the mere
history of heresy as showing the need for a dogma which should give no
foothold to reason. Like the Arians, the Monophysites had divided into
warring sects, their crux being that of the corruptibility or
incorruptibility of the body of Christ; and the two parties thus formed
split in turn into five. The total schism was in the main racial,
Egyptian opposing Greek; and the carnal jealousies of the patriarchs
and bishops seem to have played a great part in creating it; but
nothing could arrest the process of sub-division and strife. In one
furious feud over the election of a bishop of the Monophysite church of
Alexandria, a hundred and seventy years after the first Eutychean
schism, the fighting reached the lowest stage of savagery; and
Justinian&rsquo;s general Narses, who supported the
&ldquo;incorruptible&rdquo; candidate at the behest of the empress
Theodora, had to burn a large part of the city before he could carry
his point. Soon afterwards, another imperial nominee, who entered the
city in battle array, had to fight for his place; and the carnage was
enormous. In every doctrinal strife in turn the parties proceeded to
bloodshed with a speed and zest which turned to derision the moral
formulas of their creed. Such social delirium was chronic in
Christendom from the age of Constantine to the triumph of the Saracens;
and, needless to say, under such conditions there was no progress in
civilization.</p>

Intellectual Stagnation</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the intellectual side, ancient Christianity is
on the whole at its strongest in the West, just before the fall of the
western empire, as if the last mental energies of the Roman
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>world had there found a channel. Augustine
passed on to the middle ages a body of polemic theology sufficiently
vivacious to constitute a Christian classic; and in him at last the
Latin church had produced a personality comparable to Origen. Jerome,
on the other hand, could compare with Origen as a scholar, and like him
he laid bases for the scholarship of a later and reviving age. But the
total achievement of Christianity on behalf of ancient civilization had
amounted to nothing. By spreading the dogma that error of belief,
whether as paganism or as heresy, doomed men to eternal torment, it
negated the very basis of human brotherhood, and gave a new dominion to
hate, individual and corporate. It made neither good rulers nor a sound
society. Valentinian must have been made tolerant in state affairs by
the spirit of pagan policy: as a man he was so abnormally cruel that
had he been a pagan the historians would have compared him to Nero.
That a year after Julian&rsquo;s death there should be on the throne a
Christian emperor who caused offenders to be thrown to wild bears in
his own presence is a memorable item in Christian history. Of his Arian
brother Valens it is told that he caused to be burned at sea a shipload
of eighty ecclesiastics who had come to him as a deputation. This may
be an orthodox fiction; but such fictions are themselves signal proofs
of demoralizing malignity; as is the orthodox suppression of the story
of how the Arian bishop Deogratius at Carthage succoured the captives
brought by the Vandals from the sack of Rome&mdash;one of the rare
records of magnanimous humanity in the history of the age.</p>
<p class="par">From the orthodox themselves we know how Pope Leo had
banished and imprisoned the Manich&aelig;ans and Pelagians who sought
refuge at Rome when the Vandals attacked Carthage. The emperors exhibit
the process of decivilization. Valentinian died of rage: his pious sons
were weaklings; and Theodosius, when the rabble of Thessalonica braved
him by murdering his governor for enforcing the law against a popular
charioteer, treacherously planned a systematic and indiscriminate
massacre by which there perished from seven to fifteen thousand men,
women, and children. No pagan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155"
href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>emperor had ever done the
like; and no such number of Christians can have been put to death by
Nero. Heraclius, after beheading Phocas, sent his head and limbs to be
dragged through the streets of Constantinople&mdash;a reversion to
barbarism. Two centuries earlier (415) a rabble of Alexandrian monks,
acting in the interest of Cyril the Patriarch, seized the pagan teacher
Hypatia, stripped her, tore her flesh from her bones with shells, and
burned the remains. It is one of the anomalies of historiography that a
moral rebirth of the world should have been held to begin in an age in
which such things could be. Rather the Mediterranean world had grown
more neurotically evil than ever before. The facts that Bishop Ambrose
of Milan denounced the act of Theodosius, forcing him to do penance for
seven months before re-admitting him to worship, and that Theodosius in
his remorse submitted to the sentence and was afterwards less
vindictive, are the best that can be recorded <i>per contra</i>.
Ambrose himself warmly justified the burning of Jewish synagogues; and
while he, with all his ecclesiastical frauds, showed a public spirit,
it is a commonplace of Christian history that from the third century
onwards bishops in general were self-seekers, who battled furiously
over questions of diocesan boundaries, and were the ideal contrast to
the legendary apostles. Among the Christianized barbarians who in their
turn overran the empire the moral phenomena become even worse, their
religion seeming only to make them more savage and vicious.</p>
<p class="par">All that Christianity had yielded under the form of
moral betterment was an increasing glorification of chastity and
celibacy, with some restraint on infanticide. When the western empire
is on the verge of destruction, Rome being already sacked, we find
Jerome expanding in an insane exultation over the news that a young
Roman lady had taken the vow of virginity, an event to which he
ascribes cosmic importance. The mother of such a virgin, he declares,
becomes <i>ipso facto</i> &ldquo;the mother-in-law of God.&rdquo; As
always happens where sexual virtue is identified with abstinence, vice
was excessive. Chrysostom in the East, and Salvian in Gaul, testify
that alike in licence and in cruelty the Christianized <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>State at the beginning of the fifth century was
the worsened copy of the pagan world of four centuries before. The
Greek Basil and the Italian Ambrose alike bear witness to the survival
in the Christian Church of all the excesses of the old Bacchanalia.
Even the tradition that in the reign of Honorius (404) the horrible
gladiatorial games were abolished, is admitted by Christian scholarship
to be false. It may be that a humane monk did lose his life in trying
to stop them; but there is clear proof that the games subsisted in
Christian Gaul at a later date, though even humane pagans had called
for their abolition, and their cost was a heavy burden on the falling
revenue. Centuries before the time of Honorius, Apollonius of Tyana was
credited with causing them to be abolished at Athens. Not till the
Gothic conquest did the games cease in the West; nor did the piety of
Honorius and his advisers withhold them from treacherous massacres, and
from enacting the punishment of burning alive for frauds on the
fisc.</p>
<p class="par">And the wrong of wrongs was left not only untouched but
unchallenged. Slavery remained, and the average lot of the slave was no
better than in the Rome of Horace. Christian matrons in the East were
as cruel mistresses as those of the West in the days before Nero. That
Christian credences counted for little in setting up even the species
of virtue most esteemed may be gathered from the Confessions of
Augustine. By his own account, what first drew him in his youth to
moral reflection and conduct was not the pious teaching of his mother
but the writing of Cicero; he was scrupulous as a Manich&aelig;an
before he became orthodox; and his charges of hypocrisy against some
Manich&aelig;ans merely place the heretical sect on a level with the
orthodox. As regarded the weightier matters of morals there could be no
vital reform, because there was at work neither an intellectual force
nor a self-saving pressure from the wronged orders of society. The
ethic which led Origen to make himself a eunuch was not a force for
betterment.</p>
<p class="par">A survey of the literature of the fourth and fifth
centuries will make equally clear the failure of Christianity to renew
the mental life which had been dwindling in the Hellenic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>world since the days of Alexander, and in the
western since those of Augustus. No modern seeker for wisdom or beauty
in ancient lore thinks of turning for it to the Greek and Latin
writings of the age of established Christianity. Augustine, whose
energy was sufficient for a great literary performance, leaves a mass
of work out of which two or three treatises only have any truly
literary as distinct from an arch&aelig;ological interest; and these
are vitiated as compared with good pagan work by their wearisome
hysterical pietism no less than by their utter lack of serenity. The
Confessions, which might have been a great human document, are reduced
by their religious content almost to the plane of the surrounding
wilderness of rhetorical theology, whereof a library still subsists,
unreadable and unread. Rhetoric, the bane of the decadent pagan
literature, infects equally all the Christian writers, giving to the
most vehement the ring of inflation and false passion. Literature of
artistic or intellectual value was almost at an end. Such Christian
poets as Prudentius and Paulinus have indeed merit in their kind; but
they could not begin a literary renascence under the conditions set up
either by fanatical Christianity or by the worldly spirit which divided
with fanaticism the control of the Christian Church and State in the
West as in the East. And when the spirit of literature did later
revive, it turned with less zest to the pietists named than to their
pagan contemporary Claudian, who if not a great poet is yet high among
the lesser classics of Rome.</p>
<p class="par">It would seem as if Claudian, coming to the writing of
Latin after a Greek education, was partly saved by that circumstance
from the artistic fatuity which had become normal among the westerns as
among the easterns. The need to think in a new speech may have
vitalized his use of it. But he remained wholly pagan in his creed. And
such pagan thinkers as Macrobius and Simplicius, though unoriginal in
comparison with those whom they commented, reward attention in many
ways better than do their contemporaries of the Church. What of
permanent appeal there is in the teaching of Augustine comes largely
from his early philosophic culture; and Ambrose has hardly anything in
the way of serious or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href=
"#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>philosophic thought which he does
not borrow from pagan lore. Boethius, the last of the ancient
philosophers, was a Christian only in name, expounding its orthodox
dogma as a lawyer might expound law: when he came to write his
consolations in prison he went back to the ancient and universal ethic,
putting aside his creed as he might a mask. The vogue of his book in
the Dark Ages is the expression of thinking men&rsquo;s satisfaction in
a late Latin treatise which brooded gravely on life and death in terms
of human feeling and wisdom, with no hint of the formulas of the
priest.</p>
<p class="par">On the side of science in particular and education in
general the Christian tendency was increasingly repressive. When
Christianity was established there were still grammar schools in every
considerable town in the empire, and many higher schools in the great
cities; and though for long the Christians were fain to use these
schools, pagan as they were in character, by reason of their almost
purely literary or rhetorical curriculum, the Church gradually let them
die out, never even attempting a Christian system of education, apart
from a few theological schools. Nor did the process of extinction of
knowledge end there. Early in the fifth century Theodosius II forbade
all public lecturing by non-official teachers; and a century later
Justinian plundered and abolished the philosophical schools at Athens,
thus ending the last vestige of the higher intellectual life. Pope
Gregory the Great fanatically discouraged literary culture; and in the
East it soon became a matter of orthodox rule that the laity should not
read the sacred books, the only literature that could well come in
their way. Science so-called was practically a synonym for heresy: it
was denounced as impious by zealous believers in the third century; and
in the sixth we find Cosmas &ldquo;Indicopleustes,&rdquo; the Indian
voyager, a Nestorian Christian, denouncing the pagan doctrine of the
roundness of the earth, and religiously demonstrating that it is an
oblong plane. Medicine had gone far under pagan auspices, and Antoninus
Pius had provided for municipal physicians throughout the empire; but
the Christians, seeing heresy in all science, put prayer and exorcism
above leechcraft; the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href=
"#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>temple-schools of the healing God
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2750" title=
"Source: Aesculapius">&AElig;sculapius</span> were closed with the
rest, and medical like other science virtually died out of Christian
hands, to be recovered from old Greek lore by the Saracens. Gregory the
Great exhibits the superstition of an ignorant Asiatic.</p>
<p class="par">What the world needed above all things was new study and
real knowledge in place of rhetoric: the fatality of the Christian
system was that it set up the conviction that all vital knowledge was
contained in itself. Yet all the while the religious habit of mind,
which saw in pious fraud a service to deity, had almost destroyed the
rational conception of truth, so that a thousand years were to elapse
before human testimony could return to the standards of Thucydides, or
human judgment rise above a gross credulity. Had it been only in the
West, overrun by barbarism, that the lights of knowledge and art went
out, the barbarian invasion might be put as the cause; but the history
of Christian Byzantium is the history of an intellectual arrest of a
thousand years on the very soil of civilization.</p>

Failure</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Of the eastern Christian empire as it is left
curtailed of more than half its area by the Moslem conquest, the one
thing that cannot be predicated is progress or transformation. Here
again it would be an error to regard Christianity as the cause of
stagnation: the whole political science of antiquity had been markedly
conservative; but it must be noted that historic Christianity
absolutely endorsed the ideal of fixity. Only conditions of stimulating
culture-contact could have preserved a vigorous mental life under its
sway; and the condition of Byzantium was unhappily one of almost
complete racial and religious isolation. The Byzantium of Justinian and
Heraclius is almost the ideal of ossification; its very disorders are
normal, the habitual outbreaks of a vicious organism. There is nothing
in pagan history to compare with the chronic pandemonium set up in
Christian Constantinople by the circus factions of blues and greens,
whose mutual massacres in generation after generation outdid the
slaughters <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>of many civil wars. As painted by its own
Christian censors, the Byzantine town population of all orders was at
least as worthless as that of pagan Rome in its worst imperial days; it
realized the ignorance and unprogressiveness of imperial China without
the Chinese compensations of normal good nature, courtesy, domestic
unity, and patient toil.</p>
<p class="par">Industry indeed there must have been; it was perhaps the
silk industry introduced by Justinian that began the economic salvation
of the State; but the law prescribed a system of industrial caste,
binding every man, as far as might be, to his father&rsquo;s trade,
which must have kept the working populace very much on the level of
that of ancient Egypt. Nor can matters have been socially much better
in the West, whether in Italy under Byzantine or Lombard rule, or in
the new barbarian States, Arian and Catholic. Everywhere the old
inequalities of law were rather worsened than cured, and no Christian
teacher dreamed of curing them. The ideals of the most earnest among
them, as Jerome and Paulinus, began and ended in mere pietism and
physical self-mortification.</p>
<p class="par">It is not surprising, then, that all over the Christian
world the most salient social result of the creed was the institution
of monasticism, a Christian adaptation of a usage long common in
religious and down-trodden Egypt. Everything conduced to promote it.
The spectacle of constant strife and sensuality in the cities moved
suffering souls of the unworldly type to withdraw to solitude or the
cloister; all the leading teachers applauded the ideal, while
denouncing its abuses; and for multitudes of unfortunate or inferior
types, avoiding toil or escaping tyranny, then as later, the life of
the monk or even of the hermit, though poor, was one of relative ease
and idleness, greatly preferable to that of the proletary, since all
could count on being at least maintained by popular charity, if not
enriched by the believers in their sanctity. To these types were added
that of the ignorant fanatic, which seems to have been as numerous as
that of the slothful, and which under monastic conditions seems to have
become more fanatical than ever. Thus some of the best and much of the
worse moral elements, the latter of course immensely <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>predominating, combined to weaken the social
fabric, the former by withdrawing their finer personalities from a
world that doubly needed them; the latter by withdrawing hands from
labour and widening the realm of ignorant faith. Some powerful
personalities, as Basil and Chrysostom and Gregory, were bred in the
monastic life; but in the main it was a mere impoverishment of
civilization. In the critical period of Christian history the monks are
often found zealous in works of rabid violence, such as the destruction
of pagan temples and Jewish synagogues, and the horrible murder of the
pagan girl-philosopher Hypatia in Alexandria; and they too had their
furious dogmatic strifes, notably in the fourth and fifth centuries,
when those of Egypt constituted themselves the champions of the
orthodoxy (then impeached) of Origen, for no clear reason save perhaps
the fact of his self-mutilation. But, as Christian historians have
remarked, they seem to have done nothing to resist the ruinous
onslaught of Islam, which above all things despised monks. For that
matter, the hierarchy did no better. The hierocracy established in
Spain under the Visigoths served so to emasculate or paralyse the race
that after an undisturbed life of three hundred years it fell in a day
before a handful of Moslem filibusters from North Africa.</p>
<p class="par">There is reason to believe, finally, that the
intellectual as well as the political abjection of the Christian mass
in Syria, Egypt, and North Africa made multitudes ready material for
Islam, even as sectarian hatreds made others welcome the conqueror, and
resent only his toleration of their opponents. Christian faith availed
so little to make head against the new faith which assailed it, that we
must infer a partial paralysis on the Christian side as a result of
Moslem success. Success was the theological proof of divine aid; and
many calamities, such as earthquakes, had previously seemed to tell of
divine wrath against the Christian world. Such arguments shook
multitudes. Numbers apostatized at once; and when the Moslem rule was
established from Jerusalem to Carthage, the Christian Church, tolerated
only to be humiliated, dwindled to insignificance on its former soil.
In the African provinces it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href=
"#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>absolutely disappeared; in the
others it became incapable of moving either Arab or Frank to respect.
Nestorian Christianity, already settled in Persia, was specially
tolerated by the Saracens, as it had been by the Persians, because of
its enmity to Christian Byzantium; but though it continued to subsist
it was by toleration and not through strength. The Nestorian clergy and
laity throve somewhat as Jews had done in Rome; but they made no
headway against Islam, and some of the Asiatic States where they had
been numerous fell away wholly to Mohammedanism. Thus was given once
more the historic proof that any religion may in time be destroyed or
degraded by brute force, provided only that the brute force be
persistent, and efficiently applied.</p>
<p class="par">What pagan Rome did not do, for lack of systematic
effort or continuous purpose, Islam did with the greatest ease, the
purpose and the effort being wholehearted. And when we compare the
later civilization of the Saracens with that they overthrew, it is hard
to feel that the world lost by the change. If monotheism had any
civilizing virtue as against polytheism, it was the Moslems, not the
Christians, who were monotheists; and the Moslem scorn of Christian
man-worship and idolatry reproduced the old Christian tone towards
paganism. On the side of morals, Moslem polygamy was indeed relatively
evil; but on the other hand the giving of alms, so often claimed as a
specially Christian virtue, was under Islam an absolute duty; Moslems
could not hold Moslems as slaves; Islam knew no priestcraft; and it
substantially excluded the common Christian evils of drunkenness and
prostitution. Almost the only art carried on by the Byzantines from
their pagan ancestors was that of architecture, their churches being
often beautiful; and this art, as well as that of working in gold, the
Saracens preserved; while it is to their later adoption of the ancient
Greek science that the world owes the revival of knowledge after the
night of the Dark Ages. Sculpture and painting were already become
contemptible in Christian hands; and literature was in not much better
case. It is to be noted, too, that the traditional blame of the Goths
and Vandals for the disfigurement of ancient Rome is misplaced, the
worst wreckers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>being the generals of Justinian and the
inhabitants themselves, always ready to ruin a pagan memorial for the
sake of building material.</p>
<p class="par">When finally we seek to realize the aspect of the
Hellenistic world in the time of Mohammed, in contrast with that of the
age of Pericles; or the Rome of Pope Gregory the Great (590&ndash;604)
in contrast with that of Hadrian, we are conscious of an immense loss
of human faculty for beauty and joy, no less than for action. It is not
too much to say that the Christian ideal of sanctity meant not only
self-mortification and sadness but squalor in the individual life.
Physical uncleanliness became a Christian virtue; and the mark of a
city built in the Christian period came to be the absence of baths.
Pagan Greece lives for ever in men&rsquo;s thought as a dream of grace
and beauty and enchanted speech; and though behind the shining vision
of art and song there lingers immovably a sombre memory of strife and
servitude, the art and the song are a deathless gift to mankind. At
every summit of its attainment our civilization looks back to them with
an unquenchable envy, an impotent desire, as of a race disinherited. To
regain that morning glory of life is the spontaneous yearning of all
who have gazed on the distant light of it. But the man who would wish
to re-create the Constantinople of Justinian or Heraclius has not yet
declared himself.</p>
<p class="par">Dream for dream, the child-like creed of the God-crowded
Hellas of Pheidias&rsquo; day, peopled with statues and crowned with
temples of glorious symmetry, is an incomparably fairer thing than the
tortured dogma of the Byzantine church, visually expressing itself in
wretched icons, barbaric trappings, and infinite mummeries of
ceremonial. Idolatry for idolatry, the adoration of noble statues by
chanting bands of youths and maidens can have wrought less harm to head
and heart than the prostration of their posterity before the abortions
of Byzantine art. Superstition for superstition, there is nothing in
old Hellene religion, with all its survivals of savage myth, to be
compared for moral and mental abjection to the practice of the
Christian Greeks, with their pilgrimages to Arabia to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>kiss
Job&rsquo;s dunghill, and their grovelling worship of dead men&rsquo;s
bones. Some Christian historians, seeking a vital test, have concluded
that under paganism there was no good &ldquo;life of the heart&rdquo;;
but whatever may be the modern superiority in this regard, there is
none to be discerned in the Christian civilizations which in the
seventh century still spoke the classic tongues of paganism.</p>
<p class="par">In the West, where a spiritual power had begun obscurely
to acquire a Roman empire which parodied the old, there is indeed a
potential superiority predicable for the new. Gregory sending Augustine
to convert the Britons is a fairer moral spectacle than that of
C&aelig;sar, bent on plunder, seeking to conquer them. But whatever
might be the moral merit of a sincere fanaticism like that of Gregory,
who trampled down culture as eagerly as he pushed propaganda, the life
of too many Popes had already shown that the new Romanism was only to
be C&aelig;sarism with a difference, and that for the spiritual as for
the temporal empire the great end was gold. Tyranny for tyranny, and
power for power, the Rome of Trajan, superb and cruel, is hardly a
worse thing than the Rome in which Popes fought with hired bands for
their chair, or sat in it through the favour of courtesans; and the
Roman populace of the days of Gregory was no worthier than that of the
days of Caracalla or of Honorius. &ldquo;Nothing can give a baser
notion of their degradation than their actions,&rdquo; says Milman,
describing the conduct of the Romans at Gregory&rsquo;s death, when
they had become thoroughly Christianized. As of old, the accident of
real merit in the ruler could avail for much in administration; but
still the calm Antonines can bear comparison as potentates and men with
any wearer of the triple crown. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165"

the Seventh Century</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When the swift triumph of Islam had cut off from
Christendom the populations among whom its creed had been evolved, that
creed ruled in the Byzantine State; in Italy, still half-imperial,
half-Lombardic; in Spain, then under Teutonic masters; in Frankish
Gaul; in parts of southern Germany; in Saxon Britain, of which the
conversion was begun by the lesser Augustine under Gregory the Great,
after the overthrow of the earlier Church by the heathen invaders; and
in Ireland, which had been largely Christianized in the fourth and
fifth centuries, apparently by Greek or eastern means. In the Moslem
world, Christianity existed on sufferance, and chiefly in heretical
forms, being Nestorian in Persia and Monophysite in Egypt, as also in
Abyssinia; but Christian Europe was now nominally agreed on the main
official dogmas.</p>
<p class="par">In the more civilized European States, specific paganism
still throve more or less obscurely, both by way of educated
antiquarianism and of peasant persistence in old ways; and the Church
framed canons against the latter and treatises against the former. The
mass of the population, however, was satisfied with the ample elements
of the old system embodied in the new. In the more barbaric States,
Christianity was even less of a modifying force than in the others.
Like the people of the empire, the barbarians carried on their pagan
rites, festivals, and superstitions under the name of Christianity;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>and whereas the educated world was in a measure
forced by its pessimists and its pietists to recognize the difference
between its documents and its practice, the more primitive races simply
translated Christian tradition and theory into the terms of their own
life. Save for an exaltation of celibacy, and a confessional
inquisition, at once prurient and puerile, into the details of the
sexual relation, it in no way changed the plane of their thought and
conduct. What it did alter was their political life, inasmuch as the
co-ordination of the priesthood made everywhere for the power of the
prince, if he had the wit to use it, the Church being everywhere shaped
as far as might be on the model and the ideal set up by
Constantine.</p>
<p class="par">Wherever the Roman empire had been, unless
anti-Christian violence has intervened, the Church system to this day
bears witness to the union of Church and State. In France, for
instance, there is still a bishop, as a rule, wherever there was a
Roman municipality, and an archbishop wherever there was a provincial
capital; and where in imperial territory there were variations in the
administration of rural districts&mdash;some being under their own
magistrates, some under those of neighbouring towns&mdash;the Church
system varied similarly. In the East, rural bishops, or
<i>chorepiscopi</i>, were common; but in the West they seem to have
prevailed only in the Dark Ages, the general tendency being to give the
rank of mere priests to the holders of country benefices, and to make
bishops the rulers of dioceses from an urban seat or
&ldquo;cathedral&rdquo; church. Country parishes, on the other hand,
were formed into groups, presided over by an <i>archipresbyter</i>,
without episcopal rank. The spirit of imperial rule pervaded all Church
life. Where large landowners under the Christian emperors had sought to
resist the centralizing system by appointing the priests on their own
estates, they were compelled to obtain the approval of the nearest
bishop; and when they sought next to do without priests, a law was
passed forbidding laymen to meet for worship without an ecclesiastic.
This principle was carried wherever the Church went, and rigid
subordination was the general result. To secure stability, however, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>Church had to rest on a recognized economic
interest throughout the priesthood; and the early practice of a
communal life for the bishop and his clergy, which was still common in
Gaul and Spain in the seventh century, was gradually broken up. The
competition of monasticism first forced upon all a stricter rule; and
priests living in their bishop&rsquo;s house became known as <i lang=
"la">canonici regulares</i>, &ldquo;canons regular,&rdquo; or under
rule&mdash;a duplication of terms, since &ldquo;canon&rdquo; originally
meant &ldquo;rule,&rdquo; and &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; was simply
&ldquo;regular.&rdquo; But the obvious financial advantages, as well as
the liberties of the unattached priests, soon made their status the aim
of all not devoted to the monastic ideals. The change was furthered by
the habit of leaving endowments to individual churches and to
individual offices; till at length, even in the cathedral towns, the
canons lived apart, each with his own revenue, though often dining at a
common table; while the country priests necessarily became still more
their own masters in the matter of income. Thus arose the
&ldquo;secular clergy,&rdquo; the title of &ldquo;regular&rdquo; being
restricted to those who lived under a monastic rule&mdash;as that of
Benedict or that of Augustine; and these in turn came to be classed
with monks as distinguished from the others. In addition, there sprang
up in the Middle Ages a number of unattached or itinerant priests, as
well as private chaplains.</p>
<p class="par">In every order alike, however, an economic interest was
sooner or later the ruling motive. Beneficed priests wrought for the
church under which they had their income, keeping as much of it as they
could, but recognizing the need for official union; and the monastic
orders in their turn grew wealthy by endowments, and zealous in
proportion for the temporal power of the Church. As always, the
self-denying and devoted were a minority; but the worldly and the
unworldly alike wrought everywhere in the political interests of the
kings, who had established and endowed the Church to begin with, and
who in return were long allowed many liberties in the appointment and
control of bishops and priests. A common result was the appointment of
lay favourites or benefactors of the king; and bishoprics seem almost
as often as not to have been in some degree purchasable. The Church, in
short, was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>a social and political function of each State,
with the papal system loosely and variably co-ordinating the whole.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">&sect; 2.</span> <i>Methods of
Expansion</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Every extension of the Church being a means of
power and revenue to priests, the process was furthered at once by
motives of selfishness and by motives of self-sacrifice. In some cases
the latter were effectual, as when a pious hermit won repute among
barbarians for sanctity, and so acquired spiritual influence; but the
normal mode of conversion seems to have been by way of appeal to chiefs
or kings. When these were convinced that Christianity was to their
interest, the baptism of their more docile subjects followed wholesale.
Thus ten thousand Angli were claimed as baptized by Augustine in Kent
on Christmas Day in the year 597&mdash;a transaction which reduced the
rite to nullity, and the individuality of the converts to the level of
that of animals. In this case there can have been no rational consent.
A little later, Heraclius in the East caused multitudes of Jews to be
dragged to baptism by force; and the same course was taken in Spain and
Gaul. Jews so coerced were only more anti-Christian than before; and
wholesale relapses of barbarian converts were nearly as common as the
wholesale captures, till the cause of kings won the mastery. Nowhere
does the Church seem to have grown from within and upward among the
barbarians as it had originally done in the empire: the process is
invariably one of imposition from without and above, by edicts of
kings, who supported the missionaries with the sword. As at the outset
of the Church, there were deadly strifes among the pioneers. The
earlier British Church having been formed under influences from
Ireland, there was such utter hatred between its remnants and the
Romanized Church set up by Augustine that, apparently after his death,
twelve hundred monks of the older church were massacred at Bangor in
one of the wars between the two Christian parties; and the Britons, not
unnaturally, refused to have any intercourse with their brethren,
regarding them as worse than heathens. The Englishman Boniface, who
played a large part (720&ndash;55) in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>the Christianization
of northern Germany, and who in the usual fashion claimed to have
baptized a hundred thousand natives in one year, secured the
excommunication of several rival bishops of the anti-Roman school; and
those who would not accept re-ordination at his hands he sought to have
imprisoned or flogged, denouncing them, in the style of the Churchman
of all ages, as &ldquo;servants of the devil and forerunners of
Antichrist.&rdquo; His authority was established in new districts at
the head of an armed force; and when with fifty priests he met his
death (755) in Friesland at the hands of heathen natives, he was
marching with a troop of soldiers. Even where force was not used, the
persuasions offered were of the grossest kind. Thus a friend of
Boniface is found advising him to point out to the heathen that the
Christians have the bulk and the best of the world, possessing all the
rich lands which yield wine and oil, while the pagans are now confined
to the coldest and most barren regions. No religion was ever more
unspiritually propagated.</p>
<p class="par">Under Charlemagne, Christian missionary methods left
those of Islam in the rear. For the subjection of the still free
Saxons, between the Baltic and the borders of Thuringia and Hesse, he
needed the aid of the Church&rsquo;s organization; and they, realizing
the state of the case, for the most part refused to be baptized. In his
wars with them, accordingly, he decreed that those who rejected the
gospel should be put to death. As the wars lasted thirty-three years,
the number of the slain must be left to imagination. The survivors were
finally bribed into belief by a restoration of their local rights, and
by being freed from tribute to the king. They do not seem, however, to
have been freed from the exactions of the Church, which, according to
the testimony of Charlemagne&rsquo;s adviser, Alcuin, had been a main
cause of the exasperation of the Saxons against it. Among those
exactions Alcuin mentions not only tithes&mdash;which had now become a
recognized form of Church revenue&mdash;but the infliction of many
penalties for moral and ecclesiastical offences. Such exactions the
monarch endorsed; and he it was who enforced the payment of tithes.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=

<p class="par">King and priest were thus natural allies as against the
freemen or the chieftains in each territory; and the advance of the
Church was bloody or bloodless according as the king was able to
enforce his will. In the Scandinavian countries the founding of
Christianity was a life-and-death struggle, lasting in all for some two
hundred and fifty years (820&ndash;1075), between the local liberties,
bound up with pagan usages, and the centralizing system of the Church.
Again and again the Church was overthrown, with the king who championed
it; and the special ferocity of the marauding vikings against Churchmen
wherever they went seems to have been set up by their sense of the
Church&rsquo;s monarchic function. The fact that many priests were
ex-serfs made them the more obnoxious; and they in turn would strive
the more zealously for the Church&rsquo;s protecting power. But the
Church&rsquo;s political work did not end with the humbling of the
vikings, as such, at the hands of the kings who finally mastered them;
it endorsed the aggressive imperialism of the Danish king Knut as it
had done that of Rome; and never till the time of the Crusades does the
ostensible universality of the Church seem to have checked the old play
of racial hatreds and the normal lust of conquest. So clearly did
Charlemagne realize the political use of the Church that, while he
imposed it everywhere in his own dominions, he vetoed its extension to
Denmark, where it would be a means of organizing a probably hostile
power, many of the stubborn Saxons having fled thither. From the moment
of its establishment it had been stamped with the principle of
political autocracy; and only when its own mounting power and wealth
made it a world-State in itself did it restrain, in its own interest,
the power of kings. In the earlier stages, king and Church supported
each other for their own sakes; and it was as a political instrument,
whose value had been proved in the Roman Empire, that the Church was
sooner or later accepted by the barbarian kings. All the while popes
and prelates complained bitterly that many of the converts thus won
were baptized and rebaptized, yet continued to live as heathens,
slaying priests and sacrificing to idols. When, however, open
heathenism was beaten down, the combined <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>political and
religious prestige of the Christian priest gave him a hold over the
multitude, forever superstitious, such as those of the heathen times
had never wielded save in Gaul. To the new regal tyranny was added that
of the Church. When the Servians, who had been nominally Christianized
under the rule of Byzantium in the eighth century, regained their
independence in the ninth, they significantly renounced Christianity;
and only after re-conquest were they again &ldquo;converted.&rdquo; To
this day their old pagan beliefs abound under cover of
Christianity.</p>
<p class="par">To the general rule of propagation by regal edict or by
bloodshed there were a few partial exceptions. Vladimir, the first
Christian king of the Russians (980), destroyed the old monuments and
images in the usual fashion; but under the auspices of his wife, the
sister of the Byzantine emperor, Greek missionaries set up many schools
and churches, and the kingdom seems to have been bloodlessly
Christianized within three generations. It accordingly remained
Christian under the two and a half centuries of Mongol rule, from 1223.
Elsewhere the conversion of the Slavs was a process of sheer monarchic
violence, as in Scandinavia. Always it was the duke or king who was
&ldquo;converted,&rdquo; and always his propaganda was that of the
sword. Through three reigns (870&ndash;936) heathen Bohemia was
bedevilled by dukes who coerced their subjects with the Church&rsquo;s
help; a pagan prince who led a successful revolt, but was overthrown by
a German invasion, lives in history as Boleslav the Cruel; and an
equally cruel successor, who with German help used the same means on
behalf of Christianity, figures as Boleslav the Pious (967&ndash;999).
The same process went on in Poland; the converted duke (967), backed by
his German overlords, seeking to suppress pagan worship with violence
and meeting violent resistance. So among the Wends, who were also under
German vassalage, the missionary was seen to be the tool of the tyrant,
and the cause of paganism was identified with that of national
independence. After generations of savage struggle, Gottschalk, the
pious founder of the Wendish empire, was overthrown (1066) and put to
death with torture. So in Hungary, where <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>king Stephen
(997&ndash;1038) combined slaughter with better propaganda, the
king&rsquo;s death was followed by a desperate pagan revolt, which was
twice renewed under his son.</p>
<p class="par">Century after century, expansion proceeded on the same
lines. The Finns, conquered in the twelfth century by a Christian king
of Sweden, were still persistently pagan in the thirteenth, and were
bloodily coerced accordingly. In the conversion of the Slavonic
Pomeranians in the twelfth century, armed force, headed by the duke,
was needed to secure wholesale baptisms after the fashion of Augustine
and Boniface; the people of L&uuml;beck, on the opportunity of an
emperor&rsquo;s death, revolted in favour of paganism and independence;
and the pagans of the Isle of R&uuml;gen were Christianized in mass by
Danish conquest (1168). It is recorded by the biographer of St. Otho
that the Pomeranians expressly rejected Christianity on the score of
its cruelty, saying, &ldquo;among the Christians are thieves and
robbers [unknown among the heathen Slavs]; Christians crucify men and
tear out eyes and do all manner of infamies; be such a religion far
from us.&rdquo; The attempt to convert Livonia by preaching was an
absolute failure; two crusades had to be set on foot by the Pope and
the surrounding Christians to crush its paganism (<i>circa</i> 1200);
and finally an &ldquo;Order of the Sword&rdquo; had to be organized to
hold the religious ground. A little later, two &ldquo;Orders of
Teutonic Knights&rdquo; in succession were established to conquer and
convert the heathen Prussians; and after sixty years of murderous and
ruinous warfare, &ldquo;a broken remnant, shielded in some measure by
the intervention of the popes, were induced to discontinue all the
heathen rites, to recognize the claims of the Teutonic Order, and to
welcome the instruction of the German priests.&rdquo; Another remnant,
utterly unsubduable, sought refuge with the heathen of Lithuania.</p>
<p class="par">The summary of seven hundred years of Christian
expansion in northern Europe is that the work was in the main done by
the sword, in the interests of kings and tyrants, who supported it, as
against the resistance of their subjects, who saw in the Church an
instrument for their subjection. Christianity, in short, was as truly a
religion of the sword as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href=
"#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>Islam. When the Mongols conquered
part of Russia in 1223 they not only left the Christians full religious
liberty, but let the priests go untaxed; and similarly the Turks left
to the Bulgarians their faith, their lands, and their local laws.
Christianity gave no such toleration; the lands of the heathen Slavs
and Prussians being distributed among their German conquerors. The
heathen, broadly speaking, were never persuaded, never convinced, never
won by the appeal of the new doctrine: they were either transferred by
their kings to the Church like so many cattle, or beaten down into
submission after generations of resistance and massacre. For a long
time after the German conquest any Slav found away from home was liable
to be executed on the spot, or killed like a wild beast by any
Christian who would. And centuries after the barbarian heathenism of
Europe was ostensibly drowned in blood, Christian Spain, having
overthrown the Moslem Moors, proceeded in the same fashion to dragoon
Moslems and Jews into the true faith, baptizing in droves those who
yielded or dissembled, and driving out of the country myriads more who
would not submit. The misery and the butchery wrought from first to
last are unimaginable. If the Spanish conquests of Mexico and Peru,
with their Church-blessed policy of suppressing heathenism, be added to
the record, the totality of evil becomes appalling; for the Spanish
priest Las Casas estimated the total destruction of native life at
twelve millions. All this slaughter took place by way of
&ldquo;expansion,&rdquo; and is exclusive of the further record of the
slaughters wrought by the Church for the suppression of heresy within
its established field. It is a strange prepossession that, in face of
such a retrospect, habitually concentrates Christian thought on the
remote and transient persecutions of Christianity by ancient paganism.
If the blood shed on the score of religion by anti-Christian paganism
and Christianity respectively be carefully estimated, the former might
say to the latter, in the words of the latter-day heathen king of the
Zulus who was crushed by an ostentatiously Christian statesmanship:
&ldquo;The blood shed in my reign was, to the blood shed since, as an
ant in a pool of water.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174"

Papacy</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One marked result of the triumph of Islam in the
East and of barbarism in the West was the growth of the Roman Papacy as
the supreme ecclesiastical power in Latin Christendom. So long as an
emperor had his seat in Italy, the bishop or patriarch of Rome was kept
in subordination to the State; and at Constantinople the subordination
of the patriarch never ceased. But even in the period from the
reconquest of Italy under Justinian to the final renunciation of
Byzantine rule, though the Roman patriarchs depended on the emperor to
ratify their election, the curtailment of the eastern empire, narrowing
as it did the range of the eastern Church, weakened that relatively to
the western; while the absence of local monarchy left the way open for
an ecclesiastical rule, calling itself theocratic. Had the Italian
kingdom of Theodoric subsisted, the development would certainly have
been different. As it was, even he, an Arian, was called in to control
the riotous strifes of papal factions in Rome.</p>
<p class="par">It belonged to all the patriarchates, as to all
bishoprics, that their tenants should magnify their office; and even in
the second century we have seen signs of an ambition in the Roman
bishop to rule the rest of the Church. Already, presumably, there
existed the gospel text: &ldquo;Thou art Petros, and upon this rock
(<i>petra</i>) I will build my Church&rdquo;&mdash;an interpolation
probably made in the Roman interest, and sure to sustain a Roman
ambition for general headship. But as late as the fifth century some
codices seem to have read simply &ldquo;Thou hast said&rdquo;;
(<span class="trans" title="sy eipas"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&sigma;&#8058; &epsilon;&#7990;&pi;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span></span>
instead of <span class="trans" title="sy ei Petros"><span class="Greek"
lang="grc">&sigma;&#8058; &epsilon;&#7990;
&Pi;&#8051;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>); and in the third
we find Cyprian of Carthage insisting on the independence of his Church
while admitting the ceremonial primacy of Rome&mdash;a proof that the
Roman claim was being pushed. In the fourth century Pope Damasus sought
to induce the eastern bishops to go to Rome for the settlement of
disputes as to certain eastern bishoprics; but was sardonically
admonished by a unanimous eastern council to alter his attitude. While
the old empire subsisted, the Roman bishop could get no further than
his old ceremonial status as holding <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>the primary see in
order of dignity. Neither the emperor nor the patriarch at
Constantinople would consent to vest any supreme authority in the
bishop of the ancient and relatively effete capital; and Theodosius
definitely constituted the patriarch of Constantinople the equal of him
of Rome (381), though ceremonially second to him. At the same time, the
patriarch of Constantinople was set above those of Antioch and
Alexandria, a step which promoted the worst of the later schisms and so
helped to lose Egypt and Syria. On every side, the normal egoisms and
racial instincts can thus be seen determining the fortunes of the
faith. The fling of the Greek Basil at Rome, &ldquo;I hate the pride of
that Church,&rdquo; is typical. Even while the Roman bishop was pushing
his claims to primacy, the see of Constantinople, backed by the
emperor, was taking province after province from the Roman
jurisdiction; and in 451 the Council of Chalcedon, with the support of
the eastern emperor, decreed that the bishop of &ldquo;New Rome&rdquo;
should enjoy equal honour and privilege with his rival. At the same
period the bishop of Jerusalem, claiming primacy in his turn, contrived
to gain ground as against those of Antioch and Alexandria. Each
patriarchate fought for its own hand. The use of the special title of
&ldquo;Papa&rdquo; by him of Rome was probably an imitation of
Mithraism, in the hierarchy of which the chief priest was &ldquo;Father
of Fathers&rdquo; as the God was &ldquo;Father Mithra,&rdquo; and, like
Attis, probably called <i>Papa</i>. In the Eastern Church the name
became general, all priests being &ldquo;popes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In the history of the Papacy, it is the two early
bishops most distinguished for widening the power of the Church that
alone have won the title of &ldquo;Great&rdquo;&mdash;to wit, Leo I
(440&ndash;61) and Gregory I (590&ndash;604), of whom the first began
to build up the Church&rsquo;s local patrimony on the fall of the
western empire, and the second to establish her spiritual reign in the
north. It is under the latter that the destiny of the Roman see as the
head of the western Churches begins clearly to reveal itself. The
patriarch of Constantinople of that day took to himself the title of
&OElig;cumenical or Universal; and Gregory, whose predecessors had
aimed at that very status, pronounced the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>claim blasphemous,
antichristian, and diabolical. A few years later, he was securing
through the lesser Augustine his own supremacy over the previously
independent Churches of Britain. He even seems to have cringed to the
usurping Byzantine emperor Phocas in order to get him to veto the claim
of his rival, a concession which appears to have been granted to
Boniface III in 606. Still, the papacy had to fight hard for its claims
in Britain, Gaul, and Spain; and towards the end of the seventh century
Bishop Julian of Toledo is found rating Benedict II for ignorance and
jealousy. As Julian was nevertheless sainted, we may infer that the
jealousies of rival candidates for the papacy, leading to changes of
policy, often checked its political growth. But events forced a policy.
In the eighth century the iconoclastic emperors quarrelled with the
papacy (under Gregory II) as well as with Greek orthodoxy; whereupon
the northern Lombards sought to become masters of what remained of
imperial territory in Italy; and of a series of eight or nine Popes
(730&ndash;72) the majority were fain to call in the help of the
Franks. Charles Martel did not actively respond; but his son Pepin did
twice, and as victor presented to the Pope (754) the sovereignty of the
exarchate, receiving in return the pontiff&rsquo;s sanction to depose
the last feeble Merovingian king, in whose name the house of Pepin had
ruled. The end of the new departure was the conquest of the Lombards by
Charlemagne in 774, and the establishment in 800 of the new &ldquo;Holy
Roman Empire,&rdquo; wherein the Pope was the spiritual colleague of
the emperor.</p>
<p class="par">Hitherto the bishop of Rome had been popularly elected
like every other, and subject like every other to acceptance by the
emperor. But after Pope Zacharias (741&ndash;52) the eastern emperor
was ignored; and Charlemagne was crowned as the successor, by Roman
decision, not of the old emperors of the West, but of the line of
emperors which in the East had never ceased. Constantine VI, who had
just been deposed by his mother Irene (797), was the sixty-seventh
&ldquo;Roman&rdquo; emperor in order from Augustus, and Charlemagne was
enrolled in the West as the sixty-eighth. He even received, with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>diplomatic assent of the Moslem Haroun
Alraschid, the keys of the Holy Sepulchre from the Patriarch of
Jerusalem&mdash;an empty but suggestive honour. It was thus inevitable
that the new imperial line should sooner or later seek to hold power
over the papacy as the old had claimed to do; and Charlemagne made his
force felt very much as Constantine had done, going even further in the
way of appointing bishops, and lecturing the pope at times with the
consciousness of virtual supremacy. So long as the emperor, needing and
using the services of the Church to organize his administration,
enriched the hierarchy on all hands, enforcing tithes and protecting
the entire priesthood against lay turbulence, his pretensions were
naturally allowed. Everything depended on the strength of the ruler;
and already under Charlemagne&rsquo;s good but weak son Louis we find
many of the bishops, backed by the pope, supporting the emperor&rsquo;s
rebellious sons and claiming to depose him. About 875, again, we find
Pope John VIII not only hectoring the weak Charles the Fat, but
claiming the right to choose the emperor. Until, however, there began
to rise in Italy a new and vigorous civilization, the papacy was on the
whole discreetly subject to the ratification of the northern emperors;
and this is perhaps the period of maximum demoralization and dishonour
in its history; its economic evolution being very much on the lines of
that of the original Church in the centuries from its establishment by
Constantine till the humiliation of the empire by the Moslems.
Intellectually, the papacy had no prestige within the Church. It was in
824 that a council of Frankish bishops at Paris, following on previous
declarations, denounced as absurdity the decrees of the Pope enjoining
the worship of images. Even when the Pope Gregory IV entered France to
support the bishops who backed the rebellious sons of Louis, and
threatened to excommunicate those on the emperor&rsquo;s side, the
latter treated him with indignant contempt.</p>
<p class="par">It is in this period, however, that there begins the
process of documentary fraud by which the Church, wielding the power of
the pen, gradually circumvented that of the sword. Centuries before,
the Roman see had made use of forged <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>documents in its
disputes with Constantinople; and the Greeks of the day declared such
forgeries to be a special Roman industry. As a matter of fact, most of
the early ecclesiastical forgeries had been of eastern origin: for
instance, the so-called Apostles&rsquo; Creed and the Apostolical
Constitutions. Of these the first grew up fortuitously in the third
century, and received its name after it won currency. Only in the later
middle ages was it adopted by the Latin Church. The Constitutions again
were a deliberate compilation; and the Roman Church had invented
nothing on the same scale. But in the ninth century there was
trumped-up among the Frankish bishops, under the name of Isidore
(ostensibly the popular encyclopedist of Seville, d. 636), a collection
of professedly ancient but really spurious papal decretals, partly
proceeding on previous practice, but greatly developing it as regarded
the local independence of bishops and their right of appeal to Rome.
The original motive of the fraud was local episcopal interest, the
bishops having endless causes of grievance against their archbishops,
kings, and lay lords. But Pope Nicholas I (858&ndash;67) adroitly
adopted the forged decretals, professing to have had ancient copies of
them, and thenceforth they were made the basis of the papal claims
wherever political circumstances gave a good opportunity. The bishops,
being thus delivered over to the papacy, lost much more than they
gained. A common use now made of the growing papal power was to give
monasteries an exemption from the local bishop&rsquo;s rule; and as the
monks in general at this period had a higher character for sanctity
that the bishops, who were often extremely unreverend, local sympathy
was apt to go with the former, and with the pope, whose distant
misdeeds were little known to the laity.</p>
<p class="par">As in previous ages, nevertheless, the disorders of the
papacy itself greatly hampered its advance. In the period from John
XVIII to Leo IX (1003&ndash;1048) six popes were deposed, two murdered,
and one mutilated; prolonged contests for the chair were frequent; and
in the main it was disposed of by factions of the Roman and Italian
nobility. For a time the counts of Tuscany made it hereditary in their
family; and once a Roman courtesan of the higher order decided the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>election, by help of the general worthlessness
of the Roman electoral populace, who, having neither commerce nor
industry, were fed by papal doles as of old they had been by the
emperors. In the tenth century, the papacy had reached its nadir. The
general expectation, based on the Apocalypse and other Christian
tradition, that the world would end with the year 1000, seems to have
turned the thoughts of the more serious away from worldly questions;
while the more reckless types, lawless at best in that age, exhibited
something of the wild licence seen at times in cities stricken by
pestilence, and ships about to sink. When the dreaded year was passed,
riot was even quickened; but in the eleventh century a moral instinct
began slowly to assert itself. The elections to the papacy had become
so scandalous and ruinous&mdash;three pretenders claiming the chair at
once&mdash;that the clergy themselves conceded to the emperor Henry
III, in the year 1047, the right to appoint popes; and he used his
power four times with judgment and success.</p>
<p class="par">Naturally, however, the reform strengthened the papacy
rather than the emperor. Pope Nicholas II, acting on the advice of his
powerful secretary, the monk Hildebrand, who was to be one of his
successors, decreed (1059) that the election of all bishops should lie
with the local &ldquo;chapters&rdquo; and the pope; and that the
election of the pope should in future be made by the seven cardinal
bishops of the Roman district, with the assent first of the cardinal
priests and deacons of the Roman churches, and next of the laity; the
choice to be ratified by Henry IV, then a minor, or by such of his
successors as should obtain the same privilege. Yet, on the death of
Nicholas, Hildebrand procured the election and consecration of
Alexander II, without waiting for any ratification; and when he himself
became pope as Gregory VII (1073) he was on the alert for his famous
struggle with Henry over the claim of the temporal power to appoint
bishops. Standing on the forged decretals, with an almost maniacal
belief in his divine rights, he claimed as pope not only the sole power
to confirm bishops, but the power to take or give the possessions of
all men as he would; and he threatened deposition to any king who dared
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>to gainsay him. It was in the course of the
struggle with Henry, by the use of the now common weapon of
excommunication, that he reduced the emperor to his historic act of
self-abasement (1077) at Canossa.</p>
<p class="par">The circumstances were in the main in the pope&rsquo;s
favour. Henry was rebelled against in Germany, and Gregory was well
able to manipulate disaffection. At the same time, Gregory&rsquo;s
strenuous efforts to &ldquo;reform&rdquo; the Church by forcing
celibacy on the entire priesthood had set against him multitudes of the
Italian and northern clergy, married and unmarried; and these were
indignant at Henry&rsquo;s surrender. Stimulated by their protests, and
by the sympathy of various kings whom the pope had arrogantly menaced,
he took heart, put down his rebels and rivals at home, and marched in
force into Italy, where he met almost no resistance and was crowned by
the antipope Clement III, whom he and his party had appointed. Gregory,
besieged by his own flock in the castle of St. Angelo, called in his
late-made ally the Norman Robert Guiscard, Duke of Sicily, who in
releasing him burnt much of the city, and, after a sack and massacre,
sold most of the remaining inhabitants as slaves. Everywhere the
pope&rsquo;s cause was lost, and he died defeated, in exile at Salerno
under Norman protection, hated by both priests and people as the
bringer of slaughter and misery on Germany and Italy alike. The
&ldquo;reforming&rdquo; pontiff had wrought far more evil than his most
sinful predecessors, and still the Church was not reformed.</p>
<p class="par">Henry, rebelled against by his sons, died broken-hearted
like his enemy; and for half a century the strife over &ldquo;lay
investitures&rdquo; was carried on by popes and emperors. The papacy
had thus become the evil genius at once of Italy and of Germany,
entering into and intensifying every Italian feud, and giving to German
feudalism a fatal ground of combat for centuries. Out of all the strife
the papacy made ultimate profit. When the war of the investitures was
over, it built up the Decretum of the monk Gratian, a code embodying
the Isidorean frauds with others, such as the gross pretence that St.
Augustine had declared the Decretals to be of the same status with the
canonical scriptures. The war, meantime, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>had ended in a
compromise from which also the papacy substantially gained. The result
was to turn it ere long into a vast system of financial exploitation.
Every evil in the way of simony and corruption against which Hildebrand
had revolted was further developed under papal auspices. The people
lost all power of electing their bishops; and the rich chapters, on
whom the right devolved, became the field of simony for the nobles;
while the pope drew from the sale of his ratifications an immense
revenue. So rapid was the effect of the new relation that by the middle
of the twelfth century the bulk of the current literature of Europe,
serious and satirical, was bitterly hostile to Rome, which now
impressed many instructed men chiefly as a great machine for extortion.
While the Church officially denounced usury, its own usurers were
everywhere drawing interest from prelates who had had to borrow money
to buy their investitures. The pretence of making the clergy
&ldquo;unworldly&rdquo; by enforced celibacy was under such
circumstances not edifying. Needless to say, while clerical marriage
could be officially put down, clerical concubinage was not.</p>
<p class="par">The strength of the papacy as against its many enemies
lay (1) in the strifes of States and nations, in which the pope could
always intervene; (2) in the feeling of many serious men that a central
power was needed to control strife and tyranny; (3) in the compiled
system of canon law, which expanded still further the code of the
Decretals and of Gratian, and constantly exalted the papal power; (4)
in the orders of preaching friars, who acted as papal emissaries, and
kept in partial discredit the local clergy everywhere; and (5) in the
power of the pope to appeal to the worst motives of ignorant believers.
Thus at the beginning of the thirteenth century Innocent III, a zealous
champion of the papal power, was able in the teeth of the common
hostility of educated men to evoke an immense outburst of brutal
fanaticism by offering indulgences, spiritual and temporal, to all who
would join in a crusade of massacre against the Albigensian and other
heretics of Languedoc, where the Paulician and other anti-clerical
doctrines had spread widely. Twenty years of hideous <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>bloodshed and demoralization went far to create
an atmosphere in which criticism could not breathe; and the whole
evocation of the eastern Crusades, both before and after this period,
was carried on by the popes with a clear perception of the gain to
their authority from the armed consensus of Christendom under their
appeal, on the proffer of indulgences. They had hoped to extend their
rule over the East, Christian and paynim; but though this dream came to
nothing they were nonetheless aggrandized by the effort. The revived
pretensions to dispose of all unclaimed territory on the globe, to
depose heretic princes, and to confer sovereignties, were all
reinforced.</p>
<p class="par">When the Crusades had ceased, the papal curia, growing
ever more exacting, began to draw all manner of yearly dues from
Churchmen throughout its jurisdiction, so that whereas in the
thirteenth century it had only one <i lang="la">auditor
camer&aelig;</i>, in 1370 the pope had more than twenty, and every
cardinal had a number in addition, all living like their superiors by
traffic in privileges. Under Gregory XI (1370&ndash;78), seven bishops
were excommunicated by one order for failure to pay their dues.
Complaint was universal; but the vested interests made reform
impossible. When, therefore, the Renaissance gradually gained ground
against all obstacles, and masses of men became capable of judging the
papacy in the light of history and reason as well as of its own code,
it was inevitable that as soon as local economic interests became
sufficiently marked, an institution which was everywhere an economic
burden should incur an economic revolution.</p>
<p class="par">In the meantime, the papacy had possessed itself of the
power of life and death in the intellectual as well as in the religious
sphere. The power it arrogated to itself under the false Isidorean
Decretals carried implicitly if not explicitly the attribute of
infallibility. To pronounce doctrines true or false had anciently been
the function of councils; it now became the function of the pope, who
thus treated councils exactly as kings later treated parliaments. Of
old, successive popes had notoriously declared for contrary dogmas;
many had contradicted themselves; and down to the thirteenth century
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>there had been a score of papal schisms, all of
which were surpassed by those of the fourteenth century; but that
reflection put no check on later decisions on the most momentous
problems. The religion which began in private dissidence from Jewish
and pagan orthodoxies had become the most iron dogmatism the world had
ever seen; and the whole system of Christian credence had come to turn
on the fiat of one man. At his sole veto the sciences must be dumb; and
to him must come for sanction those who would found new schools. The
faith that had begun as &ldquo;liberty from the yoke of the law&rdquo;
had come to elevate the negation of mental liberty into a principle of
universal polity, translating into the inner life the despotism which
the older Rome had placed on the outer.</p>
<p class="par">Latin Christianity had thus duplicated on the one hand
the development of ancient Gaulish Druidism, wherein the priests were a
sacred and ruling caste and the arch-Druid semi-divine, and on the
other hand the evolution of the ancient Egyptian system, under which
latterly the priesthood compelled the king to obtain the approbation of
the sacred statues before taking any public step, till at length
&ldquo;the true master of Egypt was the Premier Prophet of the Theban
Ammon,&rdquo; interpreter of the God, and priest also of the
mediatorial Son-God Khonsu. In all cases alike the sociological
causation is transparent from first to last; and equally clear are the
special conditions which prevented the Holy Roman Empire from following
to the end the path trodden by ancient Egyptian and Roman imperialism.

Idolatry and Polytheism</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">By the seventh century all that idolatry had meant
for the early Christists was reproduced within the Christian Church in
East and West. There was nothing, to begin with, in the inner life of
the populace in the Christian period that could keep them from the
kinds of belief natural to the multitude in pagan times. Only under the
stress of a zealous movement of reform, backed up by fanatical power,
had image-worship ever been put down for a single nation, as among the
Persians and later Jews; and only the original Jewish taboo, backed by
the Jewish sacred books, could have kept Christism anti-idolatrous for
any length of time after it had passed beyond the sphere of Jewish
proselytism. After it had become a State religion, the adoption of
images was as necessary to its popularity as the adoption of pagan
festivals and rites. Images of martyrs and holy men deceased seem to
have been first venerated; and when the bones of such were held to have
miraculous virtue, and their spirits were believed to haunt their
tombs, it was impossible that their effigies should not come to have
similar repute. Dust from Palestine or other holy places, again, was
early regarded as having magical virtue&mdash;a permitted belief which
prepared the way for others. So with the figure of the Christ. From the
first, the sign of the cross was held to be potent against evil
spirits; and Helena, the mother of Constantine, gave an irresistible
vogue to the worship of what was alleged to be the true cross, and to
have worked miraculous cures. As early as the fourth century the
Christians at Paneas in Palestine seem to have taken an old statue of a
male and a female figure as representing Jesus healing the believing
woman; and in the sixth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>century paintings on linen, held
to have been miraculously made by the face of the Saviour, began to be
revered. Being so different from pagan statues, the &ldquo;idols&rdquo;
of Jewish aversion, they readily passed the barrier of the traditional
veto on idolatry. Here again, however, the lead came from paganism, as
we know from Juvenal that many painters in his day &ldquo;lived upon
Isis,&rdquo; then the fashionable foreign deity at Rome. Crucifixes and
images of all kinds inevitably followed. Valens and Theodosius passed
laws forbidding pictures and icons of Christ; but such laws merely
emphasized an irrepressible tendency. As for Mary, her worship seems
from the first to have been associated with that of old statues of a
nursing Goddess-Mother, and the statues followed the cult, some black
statues of Isis and Horus being worshipped to this day as representing
Mary and Jesus.</p>
<p class="par">When an image was once set up in a sacred place, there
soon came into play the old belief, common to Egyptians and Romans,
that the spirit of the being represented would enter the statue. Hence
all prayers to saints were addressed wherever possible to their images,
and the same usage followed the introduction of images of Jesus and the
Virgin. And while the Theodosian code contained laws prohibiting on
pain of death the placing of wreaths on pagan statues and the burning
of incense before them, the Christian populace within a century was
doing those very things to the statues of saints. In the same way the
use of holy water, which in the time of Valentinian was still held
un-Christian, became universal in the Church a century or two later.
Images could not well be left out. The old Judaic conception of the
supreme being was indeed too strong to permit of his being imaged;
though in the fourth century the Aud&aelig;ans, a Syrian sect of a
puritan cast, held that the deity was of human shape, and were
accordingly named Anthropomorphites; but the orthodox insistence on the
human form of Jesus was a lead to image-making. Thus for the Moslems
the eastern Christians were idolaters as well as polytheists; and the
epistles of Gregory the Great show him to have zealously fostered the
use of miraculous relics and sacred images in the West. Professing to
condemn the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>worship of images, he defended their use against
Bishop Selenus of Marseilles, who ejected them from his church. One of
Gregory&rsquo;s specialties in relics was the chain of St. Paul, from
which filings could be taken daily without diminishing the total bulk.
It was presumably while all pagan usages were still familiar that the
Italian Christians adopted the custom of painting the statues of saints
red, in the common pagan fashion, as they did the old custom of
carrying the images in procession. For the rest, they had but to turn
to the lore of the pagan temples for examples of statues brought from
heaven, statues which worked miracles, statues which spoke, wept,
perspired, and bled&mdash;all of which prodigies became canonical in
Christian idolatry.</p>
<p class="par">Some scrupulous and educated Christians, such as
Epiphanius and Augustine, had naturally set their faces against such a
general reversion to practical idolatry, just as many educated pagans
had done on philosophical grounds; and the council of Elvira in the
fourth century condemned the admission of pictures into churches. But
this had no lasting effect. In the eighth century, when it could no
longer be pretended that Christian images served merely for
edification, the Greek emperor Leo the Isaurian began the famous
iconoclastic movement in the East. It is probable that he was
influenced by Saracen ideas, with which he often came in contact;
though it has been held that his motive was mainly political, the local
worship of images having weakened the central authority of the Church.
But after some generations of struggle and fluctuation, despite the
ready support given to iconoclasm by many bishops, the throne reverted
to orthodoxy, and idolatry thenceforth remained normal in the Greek as
in the Latin Church. The one variation from pagan practice lay in the
substitution of pictures and painted wooden images or <i>icons</i> for
the nobler statues of past paganism, with which indeed Christian art
could not pretend for a moment to compete.</p>
<p class="par">In the West, though the iconoclastic emperors met from
the popes not sympathy but intense hostility, leading soon to the
severance of Rome from the empire, we find in the ninth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>century a remarkable opposition to image-worship
on the part of Claudius bishop of Turin, and Agobard bishop of Lyons,
both of whom show a surprising degree of rationalism for their age.
Claudius opposed papal claims as well as saint-worship and
image-worship, and when condemned by a council of bishops called them
asses. Agobard opposed all the leading superstitions of his day, even
going so far as to pronounce the theory of plenary inspiration an
absurdity. As both men were born in Spain, there is reason to suspect
that they like Leo had been influenced by the higher Saracen thought of
the time. In any case, their stand was vain; and though the northern
nations, mainly perhaps by reason of their backwardness in the arts,
were slow to follow the Italian lead, a century or two sufficed to make
the whole Latin Church devoutly image-worshipping. At no time, of
course, had any part of it been otherwise than boundlessly credulous as
to miracles of every order, and as to the supernatural virtue of relics
of every species; and both, accordingly, abounded on all hands. The
average mass of Christendom was thus on the same religious and
psychological plane as pagan polytheism.</p>
<p class="par">Polytheistic, strictly speaking, Christianity had been
from the first. The formula of the Trinity was no more truly
monotheistic for the new faith than it had been for ancient Egypt; and
the mere belief in an Evil Power was a negation of monotheism. But when
saints came to be prayed-to at separate shrines, and every trade had
its saint-patron, the Christian system was both theoretically and
practically as polytheistic as that of classic Greece, where Zeus was
at least as truly the Supreme God as was the Father for Christians. And
in the elevation of Mary to Goddesshood even the formal semblance of
monotheism was lost, for her worship was in the main absolute. The
worship, indeed, was long established before she received technical
divinization from the Church, such Fathers as Epiphanius and Augustine
having too flatly condemned her early worship to permit of a formal
declaration to the contrary. But in the thirteenth century, St.
Bonaventura, who expressly maintained that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>same
reverence must be paid to the Virgin&rsquo;s image as to
herself&mdash;a doctrine established in the same period by Thomas
Aquinas in regard to Christ&mdash;arranged a Psalter in which
<i>domina</i> was substituted for <i>dominus</i> (<i>in te domina
speravi</i>); and this became the note of average Catholicism. In the
twelfth century began the dispute as to the Immaculate Conception of
the Virgin&mdash;the doctrine, that is, of <i>her</i> supernatural
birth&mdash;on which in later ages the Dominicans and Franciscans
fought a bitter and obstinate battle, the latter affirming and the
former denying the dogma. After seven centuries of temporizing, the
Papacy has in recent times endorsed it (1854); but for a thousand years
it has been implicit in the ritual of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p class="par">It is not generally known among Protestants that the
deification of Joseph has long been in course of similar evolution. In
the fifteenth century, Saint Teresa seems to have regarded him as the
&ldquo;plenipotentiary&rdquo; of God (= Jesus), obtaining from the
deity in heaven whatever he asked, as he had done on earth according to
the Apocrypha. The cult has never been very prominent; but the
latter-day litany of St. Joseph treats him as at least the equal of the
Virgin. &ldquo;The devotion to him,&rdquo; says Cardinal Newman,
&ldquo;is comparatively of late date. When once it began, men seemed
surprised that it had not been thought of before; and now they hold him
next to the Blessed Virgin in their religious affection and
veneration.&rdquo; It had of course been dogmatically retarded by the
insistence on the virginity of Mary. But Gerson, one of the most
distinguished theologians of the fourteenth century, is credited by
modern Catholics with having suggested the recognition of a second or
created Trinity of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. And seeing that Joseph in
the popular medieval representations of the Advent Mystery is a
constant figure, it is inferrible that for the multitude he had
practically a divine status. The process is strictly in keeping with
religious evolution in general; and the official apotheosis of Joseph
may one day take place. For a time, in the period of the Renaissance,
there was an amount of devotion paid to St. Anna, the mother of Mary,
which might conceivably have led to her deification. Pictures
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>of that period may still be seen in Holland, in
which Anna, Mary, and Jesus constitute a Holy Family. But the cultus of
Anna had no persistent or powerful advocate, and she seems latterly to
have passed definitely into the background.</p>

the Eucharist, Purgatory, and Confession</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the first ages of the Church, the notion of the
divinity of the &ldquo;body and blood&rdquo; of the communion meal was
vague and undefined. The partakers certainly regarded the consecrated
bread and wine as carrying some supernatural virtue, since they took
away portions for medicinal use; but they thought of the meal very much
as devout pagans thought of one of the some kind in their mysteries or
temple ritual. When their ritual phraseology was challenged as giving
colour to the charge of cannibalism, the Fathers seem always to have
explained that the terms were purely figurative; and such was the
doctrine laid down by Augustine. But when pagan culture had passed
away, and there was none in the barbarized West to challenge the Church
as such, the strange literalness of the original liturgy set up the
stranger belief that what was eaten in the eucharist was by
&ldquo;transubstantiation&rdquo; the actual flesh and blood of the
God-Man. Where such a belief was possible, it was the special interest
of the priesthood to make the affirmation. A stupendous miracle, they
claimed, was worked every time the eucharist was administered; but it
was worked through the priest. He and he only could bring it about; and
thus the central mystery and prodigy of the faith, the command of its
most essential ministry, was a clerical monopoly. The economic and
spiritual centre of gravity of the entire system was fixed in the
priestly order.</p>
<p class="par">Under such a dominating conception, Christianity was for
the majority a religion neither of faith nor of works: it was a
religion of sacerdotal magic. Not he that believed, still less he that
loved his neighbour, but he only that received the mystic rite at
consecrated hands, was to be saved. Moral teaching there might be, but
more than ever it was supererogatory. Already in the fourth century the
sacerdotal quality of the rite was defined by the practice of solemnly
&ldquo;elevating&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href=
"#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>the wine and the <i lang=
"la">hostia</i> or sacrifice, as the bread was termed, before every
distribution; and it had become common to administer it two or three
times a week. Thus the <i lang="la">missa</i> or Mass, as it had come
to be termed (traditionally from the formula of dismissal, <i lang=
"la">Ite, missio est</i>, corrupted into <i lang="la">Missa
est</i>&mdash;another pagan detail), had passed from the status of a
periodical solemnity to that of a frequent service; and the rite was
developed by the addition of chants and responses till it became the
special act of Christian worship. The &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; were thus
already far on the way to be worshipped; and at the beginning of the
seventh century Gregory the Great enacted that the slightest
irregularities in their use should be atoned for by penances. Thus
&ldquo;if a drop from the cup should fall on the altar, the ministering
priest must suck up the drop and do penance for three days; and the
linen cloth which the drop touched must be washed three times over the
cup, and the water in which it was washed be cast into the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In various other ways the traditional practice was
modified. Originally a &ldquo;supper,&rdquo; it was frequently partaken
of after the <i>Agap&aelig;</i> or love feasts; but in the fourth
century the irrepressible disorders of those assemblages led to their
being officially discountenanced, and they gradually died out. Soon the
Mass in the churches became a regular morning rite, and the eucharist
was taken fasting. After Leo the Great, in the Roman services, it was
even administered several times in the day. Finally, in or before the
eleventh century, the priesthood, from motives either of economy or
sobriety, began to withhold the winecup from communicants, and to
reserve it for the priests&mdash;a practice which Leo the Great had
denounced as heretical. The official argument seems to have been that
&ldquo;the body must include the blood,&rdquo; and that the miracle
which turned the bread into flesh created the divine blood therein. One
of the most popular miracle stories was to the effect that when once a
Jew stabbed a Host, it bled; and the Host in question was long on
exhibition. Of older date, apparently, is the administration of the
bread in the form of a wafer, this being admittedly an imitation either
of the ancient pagan usage of consecrating and eating small round cakes
in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>worship of many deities, or of the Jewish
unleavened bread of the Passover. It may, indeed, have come through
Manich&aelig;ism, which at this point followed Mazdean usage; and as
the Manich&aelig;ans also had the usage of bread without wine, it may
be that both practices came from them in the medieval period. But as
the priestly practice of turning round at the altar was taken direct
from ancient paganism, with the practice of shaving the head, it is
likely that the wafer was also.</p>
<p class="par">The rite thus settled being a <i lang="la">conditio sine
qua non</i> of Church membership and spiritual life, it became the
basis of the temporal power of the Church. Without it there was no
&ldquo;religion&rdquo;; and as the communicant in order to retain his
rights must make confession to the priest at least once a year, the
hold of the Church on the people was universal. Any one rejecting its
authority could be excommunicated; and excommunication meant the
cessation of all the offices of social life, each man being forced by
fear for himself to stand aloof from the one condemned. The obligation
to confess, in turn, was an evolution from the primitive practice of
voluntary public confession of sin before the Church. When that went
out of fashion, private confession to the priest took its place; and
when the public reading of such confessions by the priest gave offence,
Leo the Great directed that they should be regarded as secret. What was
thus made for criminals an easy means to absolution became at length an
obligation for all. In the East, indeed, it seems to have reached that
stage in the fifth century, when a scandal caused the rule to be given
up, leaving to the Western Church its full exploitation. Sacerdotal
confession, thus instituted, was one more hint from the book of
paganism, sagaciously developed. In the ancient Greek mysteries,
priests had unobtrusively traded on the principle that the initiate
must be pure, first inviting confession and then putting a scale of
prices on ceremonial absolution; but in the pagan world the system had
never gone far. It was left to Roman Christianity to made it
coextensive with the Church, and thus to create a species of social and
economic power over mankind which no other &ldquo;civilized&rdquo;
religion ever attained.</p>
<p class="par">But yet a third hold over fear and faith was wrought by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>the priesthood. Even as the priestly saying of
Masses, bought at a price, was needed to keep the Christian safe in
life, so the buying of Masses could hasten the release of his soul from
purgatory after death. Purgatory was, to begin with, yet another pagan
tenet, which in the first five centuries was regarded by the Church as
heretical, though the text about &ldquo;the spirits in prison&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Pt%203:19">1
Peter iii, 19</a>; <i>cp.</i> <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%205:5">1 Cor. v,
5</a>) gave colour to it, and Origen had entertained it. In all the
writings of Ambrose it is not mentioned; Augustine treats it as dubious
in despite of the authority of Origen; and the Eastern Church has never
accepted the tenet. But in the writings of Gregory the Great it is
treated as an established principle, with the economic corollary that
he who would save himself or his kindred from prolonged pains in
purgatory must lay out money on atoning Masses. Thus the whole cycle of
real and supposed human experience was under the Church&rsquo;s sway,
and at every stage on the course the pilgrim paid toll. The episodes of
birth, marriage, and death were alike occasions for sacraments, each a
source of clerical revenue; the fruits of the earth paid their annual
tithe; and beyond death itself the Church sold privilege in the realm
of shadows, winning by that traffic, perhaps, most wealth of all.</p>
<p class="par">It was a general corollary from the whole system that
the Church had the right to grant &ldquo;indulgences&rdquo; for sin. If
the Church could release from penalties in purgatory, it might grant
pardons at will on earth. Such a doctrine was of course only very
gradually evolved. First of all, perhaps again following a
Manich&aelig;an precedent, the bishops individually began to waive
canonical penances in consideration of the donation by offenders of
sums of money for religious purposes. The principle is expressly laid
down by Gregory I. There was at the outset no thought of selling the
permission to commit an offence; the bishop merely used the opportunity
of committed offences to enrich his church, very much as the law in so
many cases inflicts fines instead of imprisonment. The procedure, too,
was local and independent, even as that of abbots and monks who sold
the privilege of seeing and kissing holy relics, which they often
carried round the country in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href=
"#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>procession for revenue purposes.
Only after such means of income had long been in use did the papacy
attempt to monopolize the former, in virtue of its prerogative of
&ldquo;the keys.&rdquo; But step by step it absorbed the power to
release from ordinary penances and to grant &ldquo;plenary&rdquo;
remission from penances; and finally it undertook, what the bishops had
never ventured on, to remit the penalties of purgatory in advance. Such
enterprise was evoked only by a great occasion&mdash;the Crusades.</p>
<p class="par">The earlier papal indulgences were remissions of
penance, and were often given on such tolerable grounds as pilgrimages
to the Holy Land, and loyal observance of the papal institution of a
&ldquo;Truce of God&rdquo; on certain days of the week; indeed, one of
the original motives may even have been that of controlling the
mercenary proceedings of bishops. But when once the popes had proffered
plenary indulgence to all crusaders, decency was at an end. It was
obvious that the effect was demoralizing to the last degree; and still
the practice continued. At the beginning of the thirteenth century Pope
Innocent III offered absolution from all sins past and future,
dispensation from the payment of interest on debts, and exemption from
the jurisdiction of the ordinary law courts, to all who would serve for
a given period in the crusade against the Albigensian and other
heretics in the territory of the Count of Toulouse. Later, similar
inducements were offered to all who would take up arms against the
Moors in Spain. If the moral sense of Christendom were not thus wholly
destroyed, it is because all social life necessitates some minimum of
morality, which no system can uproot.</p>
<p class="par">Thenceforth the practice went from bad to worse, despite
many earnest protests from the better and saner sort of Churchmen, till
it became possible for popes to allot the traffic in indulgences in
given districts as kings allotted trading monopolies, and the enormity
of the practices of the agents gave a sufficient ground for the
decisive explosion of the Reformation. Before that explosion an attempt
was made, on the lines of ancient Roman law, to give the practice
plausibility by the formula that the indulgence was granted &ldquo;out
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>the superfluous merits of Christ and the
saints,&rdquo; a treasure of spare sanctity which it lay with the pope
to distribute. But this doctrine, which savoured so much of the
counting-house, was contemporaneous with the worst abuse the principle
ever underwent after the age of the Crusaders.</p>

Heresies</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As we have seen in connection with the growth of
idolatry, there was even in the Dark Ages an earnest minority within
the Church which resisted the downward bias of the majority and of
their hierarchical rulers. In no period, probably, was the spirit of
reason wholly absent; and from time to time it bore distinct witness.
Thus we find alongside of the effort of Claudius and Agobard against
idolatry and extraneous superstitions a less vigorous but no less
remarkable testimony against the central superstition of the priestly
system. When the Frankish monk Paschasius Radbert (831) put flatly what
had become the orthodox doctrine of Rome as to the transubstantiation
of the eucharist, some of the northern scholars who had preserved the
pre-barbaric tradition were found to gainsay him. As the discussion
continued long, the liberal-minded Frankish emperor, Charles the Bald,
invited special replies; and a learned monk, Ratramnus, wrote a
treatise to the effect that the &ldquo;real presence&rdquo; was
spiritual, not corporeal. But John the Scot (then = Irishman),
otherwise known as Erigena, wrote on the same invitation to the effect
that the bread and wine were merely symbols or memorials of the Last
Supper&mdash;a heresy so bold that only the emperor&rsquo;s protection
could have saved the utterer. And his freethinking did not end there,
for in the discussion on predestination begun by the monk Gottschalk,
in which John was invited to intervene by the bigoted abbot Hincmar,
the Irish scholar was again recalcitrant to authority; while on the
question of Deity and Trinity he held a language that anticipated
Spinoza, and brought upon his memory, when he was long dead, the
anathema of the papacy. Another Irishman of the same period, Macarius
or Macaire, taught a similar pantheism in France.</p>
<p class="par">John Scotus, however, was by far the greatest thinker of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>the Dark Ages, and it was impossible that his
ideas should become normal. Not for two hundred years was there any
overt result from his and Ratramnus&rsquo;s heresy on the eucharist.
Then (1045) Berengar of Tours set forth a modified doctrine of the
eucharist which rested on that of Ratramnus, and brought on him a
series of prosecutions at Rome for heresy, from the punishment for
which he was saved by Hildebrand, as papal adviser and later as pope;
but also by his own formal retractations, to which however he did not
adhere. The populace, he tells us, would gladly have slain him; and
more than once he had narrow escapes. After all he did but affirm a
&ldquo;spiritual real presence&rdquo;; and while some of his party went
as far as John Scotus, the stand for reason was soon tacitly abandoned,
the great majority even of the educated class accepting the priestly
dogma. Not till the Reformation was it again firmly challenged, and
even then not by all the reformers.</p>
<p class="par">A similar fortune attended the attempt of the French
canon Rousselin (Roscellinus), also in the twelfth century, to
rationalize the doctrine of the Trinity. Proceeding logically as a
&ldquo;Nominalist,&rdquo; denying the reality of abstractions, he
argued that if the Three Persons were one thing it was only a nominal
thing. His heresy, however, admittedly ended in simple tritheism; and
after he, like Berengar, had on pressure recanted, his subsequent
withdrawal of his recantation did not revive excitement. Not till the
sixteenth century did Unitarianism begin to assert itself against
Trinitarianism, and Deism against both. There was indeed a great
development of general rationalism in philosophy in the twelfth
century, especially in France, as represented by Abailard; and even in
the eleventh the argument of Anselm to prove the existence of God shows
that very radical scepticism had indirectly made itself heard; but no
philosophic movement affected the teachings and practices of the Church
as such. As for the kind of rationalism which denied the immortality of
the soul, though it seems to have been somewhat common in Florence
early in the twelfth century, it never took such propagandist form as
to bring on it the assault of the papacy; and the occasional
philosophic affirmation of the eternity of matter met the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>same
immunity. It is remarkable that, despite the denunciation of all the
truths of ancient science by the Church, the doctrine of the roundness
of the earth was still affirmed in the eighth century by an Irish
priest of Bavaria named Vergilius, who was duly denounced for his
heresy by St. Boniface, and deposed by the pope, but afterwards
reinstated and finally sainted. How the doctrine fared in detail does
not appear, but the knowledge persisted; and though in the fourteenth
century Nicolaus of Autricuria was compelled to recount his teaching of
the atomistic theory, in the fifteenth his namesake of Cusa taught with
impunity the rotation of the earth on its axis, being despite that made
a cardinal; while the Italian poet Pulci with equal impunity affirmed
the existence of an Antipodes. Nicolaus of Cusa even put forth the old
pagan doctrine of the infinity of the physical universe&mdash;the
beginning of modern pantheistic and atheistic philosophy.</p>
<p class="par">As the &ldquo;false dawn&rdquo; of the Renaissance began
to glimmer, a new source of heresy can be seen in the higher
teaching&mdash;heretical in its own sphere&mdash;of Saracen philosophy,
which under Aristotelian and Jewish influences had gone far while
Christendom was sinking in a deepening darkness. The effects of Saracen
contacts, acting on minds perhaps prepared by the doctrine of John
Scotus, first became obvious in the pantheistic teaching of Amalrich of
Bena and David Dinant at the end of the twelfth century. Amalrich was
forced to abjure; and after his death his bones were dug up and burned
(1209), and many of his followers burned alive; David of Dinant having
to fly for his life. Then it was that a Council held at Paris vetoed
all study of Aristotle at the university. Yet in 1237 the veto was
withdrawn; and as Aristotle became the basis of the systematic theology
of Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274), his philosophy was thenceforth the
orthodox system in the schools. From the first it must have counted for
indirect scepticism; and in the great <i lang="la">Summa
Theologi&aelig;</i> of Thomas himself are to be seen abundant traces of
the new doubt of the age, much of it set up by reflection on the
spectacle of conflicting religious dogmatisms in the Crusades, some of
it by Saracen philosophy, especially that of Averro&euml;s [Ibn Roshd].
In Sicily and Southern Italy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197"
href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>which under Frederick II were
the special seat of this doubt and of the tendency to tolerance which
it generated, the spirit of reason ultimately fared ill; but
thenceforth an element of skepticism pervades the higher life of
Europe. Saracen science, medical, chemical, and astronomical&mdash;the
virtual foundation of all the modern science of Europe&mdash;tended in
the same direction. In Italy, in particular, respect for the Church and
papacy almost ceased to exist among educated men; and the revival of
such specific heresies as disbelief in immortality and belief in the
eternity of matter prepared the way for simple deism.</p>
<p class="par">But against all such heresy the Church could hold its
ground in virtue of its vast vested interests, as well as of the
subjection of the mass, superstitious even when irreverent. The
practical danger to the Church&rsquo;s power lay first in the growth of
anti-clerical feeling among people with religious instincts, and
secondarily in the anti-clerical economic interest of the nobility and
upper classes in all the northern countries. What delayed disaster was
the slowness of the two hostile elements to combine.</p>

Heresies</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The kind of heresy which first stirred the Church
to murderous repression was naturally that which struck at its
monopolies. After the ancient schism of the Donatists, which so
organized itself as to set up a rival Church, the sect which was most
bloodily persecuted in the period of established Christianity from
Theodosius onwards was the Manich&aelig;an, visibly the Church&rsquo;s
most serious rival. So, in the Dark Ages, the heresies which roused
most priestly anger were the movement against image-worship; the
predestinarian doctrine of Gottschalk, which, though orthodox and
Augustinian, was now felt to undermine the priest&rsquo;s power over
souls in purgatory; and that which impugned the priestly miracle of the
eucharist, the main hold of the priesthood over society. And the first
resort to general and systematic massacre as against heresy in the West
was made after there had arisen in the eleventh and twelfth centuries a
movement of popular <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198"
name="pb198">198</a>]</span>schism which assailed not only a number of
leading rites and dogmas, but flatly denied the priestly
prerogative.</p>
<p class="par">Of this movement the first stages occurred in the
eastern empire, in the sect known as Paulicians, who are first heard of
under that name in Armenia in the seventh century. Their founder,
however, one Constantine, afterwards known as Sylvanus, worked on
existing bases. The name of the sect seems to have stood for an appeal
to the teaching of Paul as against paganized Christianity; and it had
Marcionite elements; but though it was at first anti-Gnostic and
anti-Manich&aelig;an, it acquired both Gnostic and Manich&aelig;an or
at least Mazdean characteristics, even in the teaching of Sylvanus. On
the face of the case, it suggests both Persian and Moslem influences.
Its practical heresies were opposition to the adoration of images and
relics, to the use of the Old Testament, to the worship of saints,
angels, and the Virgin, and to the prerogatives of monks and priests;
the sectaries claiming to read the New Testament for themselves, in
defiance of the virtual veto of the Greek Church on such study by the
laity. For the rest, they insisted that baptism and the eucharist were
spiritual and not bodily rites, and even reaffirmed the
&ldquo;Docetic&rdquo; doctrine that Jesus had not a true human body,
and so was incapable of suffering. Their flat denial of priestly claims
marked them out as a specially obnoxious body, and they were fiercely
persecuted, the founder being stoned to death.</p>
<p class="par">Like all the other sects, they were in turn divided, and
one section had the protection of Leo the Iconoclast, who agreed with
them as to images. A later leader, Sergius or Tychicus, won for his
sect the favour of Nicephorus I; but the next iconoclast, Leo the
Armenian, resenting their other heresies, cruelly persecuted them; and
like previous heretical sects they were driven over to the national
enemy, which was now Islam. Constantine &ldquo;Copronymus,&rdquo;
seeking to remedy this state of things, transplanted many of them to
Constantinople and Thrace, thus bringing their heresy into Europe; but
in the ninth century, on the final restoration of image-worship, a vast
multitude was massacred in Armenia. Most <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>of the remnant there
went over to the Saracens, and became the fiercest enemies of the
empire.</p>
<p class="par">From Thrace, meanwhile, their propaganda spread into
Bulgaria, where it prospered, with the help of refugees from Armenia.
In the tenth century they were to some extent favoured as a useful
bulwark against the Slavs; but in the eleventh they were again
persecuted; and as the malcontents of the empire in general tended to
join them they became the ruling party in Bulgaria. Thus it came about
that the name Bulgar, Bulgarian, became a specific name in mid-Europe
for heretic (and worse), surviving to this day in that sense in the
French form of <i lang="fr">bougre</i>. The Paulicians, further, had
their own extremists, who held by the old Marcionite veto on marriage,
and received the Greek name of <i>cathari</i>, &ldquo;the
pure&rdquo;&mdash;a title sometimes given to the whole mass, from whom,
however, the purists were in that case distinguished as
<i>perfecti</i>. Either from the <i>Cathari</i> or from the Chazari, a
Turkish tribe whose Christianity in the ninth century was much mixed
with Mohammedanism, came the Italian nickname <i>gazzari</i>, and the
German word for heretic, <i>ketzer</i>. Yet another eastern sect, the
Slavonic Bogomilians, who remained monotheistic as against the dualism
of the Paulicians, joined in the wave of new beliefs which began to
beat from the East on central Europe.</p>
<p class="par">From the very beginning of the eleventh century,
outbreaks of the new heresy, always anti-clerical and anti-ceremonial,
occurred at intervals in France, northern Italy, and Germany. In some
cases, the opposition to priests, images, and Virgin-worship extended
to a denial of all miracles and sacraments, and an assertion of the
eternity of matter&mdash;apparent signs of Saracen philosophic
influence. But the movement developed a thoroughness of enmity to
everything ecclesiastical, that told of a quite independent basis in
the now widespread hostility to the Church of Rome outside of its
centre of wealth and power. For one or two generations the crusades
drew off the superfluous energy of Europe, and the new heresies were
somewhat overshadowed; but in the first half of the twelfth century,
when the crusades had lost <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href=
"#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>all religious savour,
anti-clericalism sprang up on all sides. Tanquelin in Flanders; Peter
de Brueys (founder of the Petrobrussians) in Languedoc; the monk Henry
in Switzerland and France; Eudo of Stello in Brittany, and Arnold of
Brescia in Italy, all wrought either religiously or politically against
the Church; and all died by her violence, or in prison. Arnold, the
most capable of all, was a pupil of Abailard, and his doctrine was that
the entire vested wealth of the Church should be taken over by the
civil power, leaving the clergy to live sparingly by the gifts of the
faithful. His movement, which lasted twenty years, and was very strong
in Lombardy, went so far as to set up a short-lived republic in Rome;
but it needed only a combination of the pope and the emperor, Frederick
Barbarossa, to bring the republic to the ground, and Arnold to
crucifixion.</p>
<p class="par">Among the other revolters there was a good deal of
fanaticism; but all were more or less emphatic in denouncing priestly
pretensions, sacraments, cross-worship, prayers for the dead, penance,
image-worship, church bells, altars, and even churches. It seemed as if
the end of the Church had begun. For, though each new prophet in turn
was slain, new heretics seemed to rise from the ashes. With various
positive tenets, they were at one in their enmity to the priesthood. In
Italy there flourished a sect called the Pasagini (apparently =
<i>Passagieri</i>, Crusaders) or the Circumcised, who returned to the
law of Moses and to Ebionite views of Jesus; in France, a different
order of zealots, called Caputiati from the habit of carrying an image
of the Virgin on their hats, stood for a return to primeval equality
and liberty. Between such types of heresy stood the Apostolici, mostly
poor working-folk, but with powerful sympathizers, who urged a return
to the &ldquo;apostolic&rdquo; ideal of poverty and simplicity, and
further discouraged marriage, calling themselves &ldquo;the chaste
brethren and sisters.&rdquo; Two of their leaders, Sagarelli and Fra
Dolcino, had shown the usual aversion to the Church, Dolcino predicting
the formation of native States and the purification of the papacy; so
they, too, were put to death, being burnt at the stake. And still new
revolters appeared. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201"
name="pb201">201</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At this stage there came to the front the sectaries
known in history as the Vaudois or Waldenses, a name standing properly
for the inhabitants of the Vaux or Valleys of Piedmont, but further
connected with the teaching of one Peter Waldus, a Lyons merchant,
whose followers received also the name of the Poor Men of Lyons. How
far the anti-Catholic tenets of the Waldenses derive from ancient
heresy is uncertain; but it is clear that late in the twelfth century
they were acted on by the immense ferment of new ideas around them.
Like the Paulicians, they insisted that the laity should read the Bible
for themselves; and their men and women members went about preaching
wherever they could get a hearing, and administering the eucharist
without priestly sanction. At the same time they condemned tithes,
opposed fasting and prayers for the dead, preached peace and
non-resistance, denied the authority of the pope, and impeached the
lives of the clergy.</p>
<p class="par">All of these forces of heresy, and yet others, were
specially at work in the rich and prosperous region of Languedoc, the
patrimony of Count Raymond of Toulouse. Paulicians and Waldenses,
Cathari, Albanensians or sectaries of Albano, Albigensians or sectaries
of the town of Alby or the district of Albigensium, Bogomilians,
Apostolici, Caputiati, and nondescript <i>Paterini</i> (a Milanese name
for a popular faction)&mdash;all were active in the name of religion;
and in addition there were at work heretics of another stamp&mdash;the
gay, wandering Goliards or satirical poets and minstrels, who loved the
priests and the papacy as little as did the zealots; and the graver
doubters who had got new views of life from Saracen science and
philosophy. As against the whole amorphous mass of misbelief, the
papacy planned and effected a stupendous crusade of slaughter.</p>
<p class="par">From the first the Manich&aelig;ans, as the Church loved
to call the heretics indiscriminately, had been bloodily punished. One
bishop of the eleventh century, Wazon of <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e3136" title="Source: Liege">Li&egrave;ge</span>, is to be
remembered as having protested against the universal policy of
slaughter; and another, Gerhard of Cambrai and Arras, is said to have
won over some heretics by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href=
"#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>persuasion; but these were voices
in the wilderness. Fire, sword, halter, and cross were the normal
methods of repression; and during the eleventh and twelfth centuries
thousands probably so perished. But the campaign which came to be known
as the Albigensian crusade was planned by Pope Innocent III to outdo
all the isolated punishments of the past, and it succeeded. Grounds for
quarrel with the Count of Toulouse were easily found; and the offer of
indulgences, on the lines laid down in the crusades against the
Saracens, brought eager volunteers from all parts of Europe, for only
forty days&rsquo; service was now called for. The submission of Count
Raymond was not permitted to check the massacre of his subjects. It was
in the first campaign that the papal legate Arnold, abbot of Cliteaux,
when asked at the storming of Beziers how the heretics were to be
distinguished from the true believers, gave the historic answer,
&ldquo;Kill all; God will know his own.&rdquo; By his own account they
killed in that one place fifteen thousand men, women, and children. The
chroniclers, who make the slain twice or thrice as many, tell how seven
thousand of them were found in the great church of Mary the
Magdalene&mdash;her from whom, in the legend, had been cast out seven
devils without letting of blood.</p>
<p class="par">Begun in 1209, the Albigensian crusades outlasted the
life of Innocent III, who grew sick of the slaughter while the
priesthood were calling for its extension. They praised in particular
the Anglo-French Simon de Montfort, who slew many of his victims by
torture, and tore out the eyes of many more. For nearly twenty years
the wars lasted, plunder being a sufficient motive after heresy had
been drowned in blood or driven broadcast throughout Europe. It has
been reckoned that a full million of all ages and both sexes were
slain. Yet as late as 1231 Pope Gregory IX was burning troops of the
heretics at Rome, and causing many more to be burned in France and
Germany.</p>
<p class="par">The precocious civilization of Languedoc and Provence
was destroyed, and the region became a stronghold of Catholic
fanaticism; but the political diversity of Europe baffled the papal
hope of destroying heresy. Thenceforth the anti-clerical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>animus never died out: in the course of the
thirteenth century it reached even England, then the most docile
section of the Catholic fold. Generations before Wiclif, there were
heretics in the province of Canterbury who denied the authority of the
pope and even of the Fathers, professing to stand solely on the Bible
and the principle of &ldquo;necessary reason.&rdquo; Wiclif stood on a
less heterodox plane, impugning chiefly the extreme form of
transubstantiation and the practices of the begging friars; and he was
proportionately influential. In the fourteenth century, when
international crusades of repression had become politically impossible,
the critical spirit is seen freshly at work on anti-papal lines in
England, Flanders, France, Germany, and Bohemia, as well as in Italy;
and again, the more energetic began in their earnest ignorance to frame
new schemes of life in the light of their sacred books. The lapse of
time and the continuance of orthodox culture had made an end of the old
Paulician heresy as such; and of the new movements many, like that set
up by Saint Francis in the period of the Albigensian crusades, were
meant to be strictly obedient to the Church. Such were the
&ldquo;Brethren of the Common Lot,&rdquo; a body set up in Holland by
educated Churchmen after the so-called Beghards (otherwise Beguins or
Begutt&aelig;) had there for a time flourished and degenerated. But the
Beghards and the &ldquo;Brethren of the Free Spirit,&rdquo; who spread
widely over northern Europe, had not only aimed at a communal life, but
developed the old tendency to pantheism, now gaining ground
philosophically on the lines of Averroism. Even among the Franciscans
the &ldquo;Spirituals,&rdquo; who resented the falling away of the
order from its ideals of poverty, became heretical. Some adopted the
new &ldquo;Eternal Gospel,&rdquo; by Abbot Joachim of Flora in
Calabria, in which it was declared that there now began a new
dispensation of the Holy Spirit, superseding that of Jesus. Others,
called the <i>Fraticelli</i>, or Little Brothers, had a &ldquo;Gospel
of the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; composed by John of Parma. In both cases the
spirit of revolt against the Church was marked.</p>
<p class="par">Of the heresy of the fourteenth century the high-water
mark is seen in English Lollardism, which, without touching
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>on the philosophical problem, proceeded on the
basis of the teaching of Wiclif to a kind of religious rationalism
which not only repudiated the rule of the pope but rejected the
institutions of religious celibacy, exorcisms, priestly benedictions,
confession and absolution, pilgrimages, masses for the dead, and
prayers and offerings to images; and even carried the ethical spirit to
the point of denouncing war and capital punishment. In that age, such
an ethic could not long thrive. Lollardism, encouraged by the
self-seeking nobility while it menaced only the wealth of the Church,
which they hoped to gain, was trodden down by them in conjunction with
the king and the Church when it turned against the abuses of feudal
government. But its destruction was most effectually wrought through
the national demoralization set up by the new imperialism of Henry V,
who, after passing a new statute for the burning of heretics, won the
enthusiastic loyalty of his people by his successful invasion of
France. In the corruption of that policy of plunder, and in the ensuing
pandemonium of the Wars of the Roses, Lollardism disappeared like every
other moral ideal. The time for a union of critical and rapacious
forces against the hierarchy was not yet; and when it came in the
sixteenth century the critical spirit was on the whole less rational
than it had been at the beginning of the fifteenth. <span class=

Regular and Secular</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In a world so completely under priestly rule, the
character of the priest was in general the image of his influence.
Whatever good organized Christianity did was in virtue of the personal
work of good men in holy orders; and it is comforting to believe that
in all countries and in all ages there were some such, after the
fashion of the &ldquo;parson&rdquo; in Chaucer. To such men, the
priestly status might give a special power for righteousness. But
seeing that in the average man righteousness is in the ratio of
reflection on knowledge, there is no escape from the conclusion that in
the Middle Ages most priests were poor moral forces. For their general
ignorance is beyond doubt. The number who in a given district at a
given time were unable to read Latin may be a matter for dispute; but
it is clear that what they did read was as a rule merely distilled
ignorance. And if we turn to the records of ecclesiastical legislation,
we find constant evidence, for many centuries, of the laxity of
priestly life in all grades.</p>
<p class="par">To say nothing of the perpetual scandal about
concubinage&mdash;an artificial form of sin, in itself no more decisive
against a priest&rsquo;s character than celibacy in its
favour&mdash;there is in the canons of the councils a most significant
repetition of vetoes on various lines of conduct which stand for a lack
of single-mindedness, and of serious interest in moral tasks. Century
after century, the bishops are found forbidding the clergy to tell
fortunes, to practise magic, to get drunk, to commit perjury, to take
usury, to swear, and to haunt taverns, as well as to keep concubines.
At the same time many of the bishops themselves had to be perpetually
admonished. Under Justinian we hear of two eastern bishops convicted of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>unnatural vice, and&mdash;the law as usual
exceeding the crime&mdash;punished by mutilation. Throughout the Middle
Ages, as to-day, the normal complaints against bishops are on the score
of avarice, luxury, and worldliness; but drunkenness is not unheard of;
and whatever might be said in councils as to concubinage, it was
certain that bishops took at least as much liberty of life as popes and
presbyters. So far as moral example went, then, the social influence of
the priesthood was mostly on the wrong side, since its normal
concubinage was a perpetual lesson in hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="par">On this side, doubtless, the priests were no worse than
other men; the trouble was that they set up to be better, and that the
hierarchy was always seeking to keep up the repute of clerical sanctity
by a claim to asceticism rather than by social beneficence. Thus they
put it in the power of the &ldquo;average sensual man&rdquo; to convict
of moral imposture a priesthood which, if free to marry, would have
been much less vulnerable; and by constantly stressing self-denial on a
wrong line they missed promoting self-control on right lines. The
primary social needs of the Middle Ages were peace, civism, and
cleanliness; and for none of these things did clerical teaching in
general avail. On the contrary, it was in effect hostile to all three,
since it made virtue consist in a right relation to the other world
rather than to this, made religion a special ground for warfare, and
made uncleanliness a meritorious form of
&ldquo;self-mortification,&rdquo; which in the Middle Ages was about
the last thing that could be truly said of it.</p>
<p class="par">It is not to be forgotten, indeed, that among the monks
or other clerical scholars of the Dark Ages was to be found most of
what learning and philosophy survived. The reason was that men and
youths with the studious instinct, averse to the brawling life around
them, turned to the monasteries and monastic schools as their one
refuge. But sloth and impotence equally turned thither; and where the
stronger spirits could find a peaceful and useful life without, the
sluggards failed. Monasteries were thus always half filled with men to
whom their vows were irksome; and as women were at the same time
frequently sent to convents against their will, nothing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>but
an iron discipline could keep the professed order. Given an easy abbot
or abbess, they became centres of scandal; and in the average they were
homes of fairly well-fed idleness. But the full fatality of the case is
seen only when we realize that their very successes, their provision of
a dim retreat for many men and women of refined and unworldly type,
worsened society by leaving the reproduction of the race to the grosser
and harder natures.</p>
<p class="par">The ostensible merit of monasteries, in the medieval
period, was their almsgiving. Without endorsing the mercantilist
impeachment of all such action, we are forced to recognize that theirs
demoralized as many as it relieved. Of a higher order than mere
almsgiving, certainly, was the earlier self-sacrificing service of the
mendicant orders of friars, whose rise is one of the great moral
phenomena of the Middle Ages. For a time, in the thirteenth century,
the order of St. Francis in particular not only organized but greatly
stimulated human devotion of the kind that, happily, is always quietly
present somewhere; and the contrast between the humble beneficence of
the earlier friars and the sleek self-seeking of the average secular
priest at once accredited the former and discredited the latter. But
the history of the mendicant friars as of the previous orders is a
crowning proof of the impossibility of bettering society on a mere
religious impulse, without social science.</p>
<p class="par">Credit for holiness brought large gifts and legacies
from well-meaning but ill-judging laymen and women; and nothing could
prevent the enrichment of orders which had begun under special vows of
poverty. Francis had expressly ruled that his friars should not on any
pretext hold property, and should not even be able to profit by it
through trustees; but the latter provision was annulled, and ere long
the order was as well provided for as any. The better the financial
footing, the more self-seekers entered; and these overruled the more
single-minded. This was the law of development of every
&ldquo;self-denying&rdquo; order of the Dark and Middle Ages, from the
Benedictine monks to the Knights Templars. One of the most rigorously
planned monasteries of the Middle Ages, that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>of
the lonely Chartreuse, founded by St. Bruno late in the eleventh
century, at length relaxed its austerities, and came latterly to be
known as a wholesale manufactory of a liqueur&mdash;the distinction by
which most men now know also the name of the Benedictines. In the end,
the orders of monks and friars did something for scholarship and
education, after the institution of &ldquo;lay brothers,&rdquo; who did
the menial work, left the <i>domini</i> in certain orders, especially
the Benedictine, free to devote themselves to learning; but socially
they achieved nothing. When once they had acquired
&ldquo;foundations&rdquo; they became plunderers instead of helpers of
the poor, exacting from them gifts, selling them <i>post-mortem</i>
privileges, taking the widow&rsquo;s mite and the orphan&rsquo;s
blanket for verbal blessings.</p>
<p class="par">It is always to be remembered, here as before, that
Christianity is not the efficient cause of the failures or the evils
which happen under its auspices: we are not to suppose that had
Osirianism or Judaism or Manich&aelig;ism or Mithraism chanced to be
the religion of Europe these failures and evils would have been
averted. What we are to realize is, on the other hand, that the
conventional view as to Christianity having been an abnormally
efficient cause for good is a delusion. It is not Christianity that has
civilized Europe, but Europe&mdash;the complex of political and culture
forces&mdash;that has civilized Christianity. Byzantium and Abyssinia
show what the religious system could amount to of itself. Western
Europe surpassed these States in virtue of conditions more propitious
to energy and to freedom: that was the difference. At the best,
medieval Europe was a world of chronic strife, daily injustice, normal
cruelty, abundant misery, and ever-present disease. To show that
Christianity, that is, the holding of the Christian creed by the men of
that world, made these evils less than they would have been in the same
place under any other creed, is impossible. On the other hand, it is
clear that the influence of Christian doctrine and tradition was on
some sides conservative of evil and obstructive of good.</p>
<p class="par">Those tendencies may indeed be regarded as operating in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>the intellectual life, which, though it is in
reality only a side of the sociological whole, we shall conveniently
consider apart. Under that head too we shall note the influence of the
Church for culture on the side of art. But on the side of ordinary life
the influence of the clergy as teachers had two specific tendencies
which may here be noted. One was the disparagement of women; the other
the encouragement of cruelty.</p>
<p class="par">On the first head, as on so many others, the
conventional view is a fallacy. That Christianity raised the status of
women is still a general assumption; but exact research, even when made
by an orthodox theologian, proves the contrary. Down to the nineteenth
century, the solidest rights women possessed were those secured to them
by ancient Roman law; and the tendency of Christian legislation was
certainly to restrict rather than to expand such rights. At the same
time the so-called &ldquo;Manich&aelig;an&rdquo; element in gospel
Christianity, the tendency to regard the sexual instinct as something
corrupt and unclean, gave to the ordinary language of the Fathers
concerning women a tone of detraction and aversion. The one remedy for
an overpoise of the sexual element in life, and for over-emphasis of
female function on that side, is to secure the community of the sexes
in the intellectual life; and organized Christianity, instead of
inculcating this, minimized the intellectual life all round, thus
making self-restraint a matter of morbid asceticism as against the
excess inevitably following on disuse of mind. In particular, a
priesthood nominally committed to celibacy, yet always practising in
the confessional a morbid inquisition into sexual matters, was
committed to treating women disparagingly as forces of
&ldquo;temptation&rdquo; when it was not yielding thereto. Nothing
could be more injurious to women&rsquo;s real credit. It is true that
the worship of the Virgin would in some measure counteract the
discredit; but this held equally true of the worship of many pagan
Goddesses; and there is nothing to show that the status of women was
higher in medieval Christendom than in ancient Egypt. Among the
Teutons, the moral status of women seems to have been greatly lowered
by the introduction of Christianity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">As regards cruelty, the evidence is only too abundant.
Mosheim admits that in the Crusades the Christians were more ferocious
than the Saracens; and it is historically certain that the revival of
the ancient practice of judicial torture was the work of the papacy,
seeking to extirpate heresy in the thirteenth century. From the
tribunals of the Inquisition it passed to the ordinary Church courts,
and thence, more slowly, to the courts of justice. In time it became a
daily usage. In the old burg of Nuremberg there is preserved a
collection (sometimes exhibited elsewhere) of the instruments of
torture in common use down to the age of the Reformation. It is an
arsenal of horror. Such engines of atrocity were the normal punitive
expedients of a world in which the image of the Saviour on the cross
was supposed to move men to compassion and contrition; and in which
that Saviour&rsquo;s death was held to redeem men from the penalties of
their sins. Here the practical teaching and example of the priesthood
was all for cruelty. They presided or assisted when the heretic was
racked or burned alive; and their whole conception of morals made for
such methods. Holding the madman as possessed by a devil, they taught
that he should be cruelly scourged; holding that the leper was stricken
by God for sin, they taught that he should be shunned the more.
Paganism was saner.</p>
<p class="par">Nothing is more true in social psychology than the hard
saying of Feuerbach, that &ldquo;only where reason rules, does
universal love rule: reason is itself nothing else than universal love.
It was faith, not love, not reason, that invented Hell.&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Faith has within it a malignant principle.</i>&rdquo;
Medieval Christendom is the demonstration. In that age the spirit of
reason was but occasionally glimpsed. It is seen in the teaching of
John Scotus, who, besides his concrete heresy on the eucharist, held
the all-embracing heresy that authority is derivable solely from
reason, and from his pantheism deduced the conviction that the doctrine
of hell is but an allegory, the actuality of which would be the
negation of divine goodness. But such teaching belonged rather to pagan
philosophy than to Christian faith, and was anathematized accordingly.
It never reached even the scholarly class in general; and specifically
Christian teaching <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211"
name="pb211">211</a>]</span>which aimed at softening the heart was
spread abroad to little purpose.</p>

Theology and its Effects</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There is something saddening, though not really
strange, in the failure even of the most attractive elements in
medieval Christianity to better the world. To read of the life and
teaching of St. Francis of Assisi is to come as it were in the presence
of a really elemental force of goodness. His namesake of Sales was a
persecutor; but the founder of the Franciscan order seems free of that
taint. In him the ecstasy of pietism seems purified of that correlative
of fanatic malignity which so constantly dogs it in the literature of
ancient Christianity, from the epistles of Paul to the treatises of
Augustine. We hear of his love for all animals, of his seldom-failing
goodwill to men, and his sweet contentment in humble contemplation. Yet
when we study him in relation to his age there fronts us the startling
fact that while his active career is almost exactly synchronous with
the horrible Albigensian crusades, there is no trace in the records
that he was even saddened by them. They ought to have darkened for him
the light of the sun; but not once does he seem to have given even a
deprecating testimony against them. In him, the flower of medieval
Christianity, loyalty to the faith seems to have annulled some of the
most vital modes of moral consciousness.</p>
<p class="par">So again with the influence of such a religious classic
as the <i>Imitatio Christi</i>, attributed to Thomas &agrave; Kempis,
but probably the work of several hands, in different countries and
centuries. Many men and women must have supposed themselves to live by
it; and its influence seems wholly for peace and self-surrender. Yet it
would be hard to show that it ever restrained any corporate tendency of
a contrary kind, or ruled the corporate life of a single religious
sect. The truth is that its message was for a life of isolation, as
that of the ideal monk in his cell. Seclusion and not social life,
mystic contemplation and not wise activity, duty to God and not duty to
man, are its ideals. It was in a manner the Christian counterpart of
the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius or the Enchiridion of
Epictetus<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>&mdash;a manual of the higher or inner life,
making Christianity do for medieval men what Stoicism could do for
pagans in the decadent Roman empire. But Stoicism, by Christian
consent, made for good government; and there is no trace of any such
result from the <i>Imitatio</i>. The model Christian monarch, St. Louis
of France, lived in an earlier age; and even he was a fanatic where
heresy was concerned, and a promoter of religious wars.</p>
<p class="par">The same fatality appears, again, when we turn to the
mystical theology of the German fourteenth-century school of Tauler and
Eckhart, in which both Luther and some of our own day have seen a high
inspiration. Here, perhaps, we come on the secret of the failure we are
considering. Eckhart was a scholar, who had studied and taught at
Paris, and ranked as &ldquo;provincial&rdquo; of the Dominican order
for Saxony; and Tauler was his pupil before settling at Basle. Both men
undoubtedly influenced the Brethren of the Free Spirit and others of
the so-called Beghards and Beguins, before mentioned, in particular the
sect who called themselves the &ldquo;Friends of God&rdquo;; and they
may so be said to have affected society practically, since these
movements aimed at a species of communism. But the essence of their
theology was alien to that or any organized movement, and if lived up
to would have dissolved it without the interference of the priests and
others who under authority drove women of the Beguine movement from
their homes and seized their poor goods. &ldquo;If thou wouldst have
the Creator,&rdquo; says Tauler, &ldquo;thou must forego the creature.
The less of the creature, the more of God. Therefore abjure all
creatures, with all their consolations.&rdquo; Not thus were men in
general to be taught to live more brotherlike. The rude world of the
Middle Ages went on its way, unaffected in the main either by mysticism
or by the movements which set up self-centred societies within society.
It needed a more human spirit to affect humanity in mass.</p>
<p class="par">Such a human spirit, indeed, may be held to have shown
itself in the movement set up in Florence by Girolamo Savonarola near
the end of the fifteenth century. Savonarola was moved by a high
concern for individual conduct; and his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>gospel was
substantially that of an Ebionite Christian, wroth with all luxury as
well as with all levity of life. Thus he wielded a great influence,
setting up in the splendid Florence of the later Renaissance a forecast
of the iron-bound Geneva of Calvin. It is no final impeachment of him
to say that, having gone so far, he failed and fell; but it is clear
that he could not have been a durable civilizing force. His influence
was that of a fanatic, operating by contagion of excitement and
superstitious fear, not that of an enlightener or a statesmanlike
guide. To him amenity and luxury, art and vice, selfishness and
skepticism, were alike anathema; and he set up in Florence a kind of
pietistic reign of terror, driving impressionable believers to give up
their pictures to the fire for peace&rsquo; sake, and even letting
others be forced to it by fear. On the great political need of the
Italian cities, a fraternal federation, he had no light whatever; and
we find him encouraging his fellow citizens in their fatal passion for
dominating Pisa instead of making of her an ally and a friend. Lacking
light, he finally lacked force; and when he fell, he fell utterly,
leaving no enduring ideal or discipline to his countrymen.</p>
<p class="par">Thus on every side and at every point in the history of
the ages of faith the ostensibly best religious influences are found
failing to heal society, failing to check the forces of oppression and
dissolution and strife. If we would trace the forces which really
affected social structure and raised masses of men some way in the
scale of manhood, we must turn to the clash of interests and classes,
the play of secular knowledge, the undertakings of laymen on normal
lines of aspiration and on secular views of right.</p>

and Feudalism</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">We have seen, in studying the expansion of the
Church, how it grew by lending itself to the interests of kings and
chiefs as against subjects. On the same grounds, it made for empires as
against self-governing States. But inasmuch as the papacy ere long fell
out with the emperors of the new line it had itself consecrated, it
also contributed to the break-up of feudalism, in the widest sense of
the term; and it is possible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href=
"#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>to claim for the Church, further,
a restraining influence on the oppressive action of feudalism, early
and late, in various directions. Under this head would fall to be
judged, in particular, its action on slavery.</p>
<p class="par">As the institution of slavery was taken over by the
Christian emperors from the pagan without any hint of disapproval, it
is clear, to begin with, that the Church had in its days of struggle
made no sign of such condemnation. Nor was there anything in its sacred
books to suggest a repudiation of slavery; on the contrary, Jesus is
made to accept it as a matter of course (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2017:7-10">Luke xvii,
7&ndash;10</a>; Gr.); and Paul, in a passage which has been garbled in
the English translation, expressly urges that a Christian slave should
remain so even if he have a chance to become free (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%207:20-21">1 Cor.
vii, 20, 21</a>). He and some of the Fathers certainly urge that slaves
should be kindly treated; but many pagans had done as much, and Seneca
on that theme had outgone them all. Laws for the protection of slaves,
too, had been enacted by many emperors long before Constantine. The
only ground, then, on which Christianity could be credited with setting
up by religious appeal an aversion to slavery would be a visible
increase in manumissions after the time of Constantine. No such
increase, however, took place.</p>
<p class="par">A misconception on the subject has arisen by way of a
hasty inference from the fact that in the Christian period all
manumissions were religious acts, performed through the Church. This
was no result of any Christian doctrine, being in fact a deliberate
imitation of pagan practice. Before Constantine, as we have seen, the
act of manumission was a religious one, performed as such in the pagan
temples; and when Constantine adroitly transferred the function from
those temples to the churches, he probably put a check on the process
of liberation, since pagans would long be reluctant to go to the
churches for any purpose<span class="corr" id="xd21e3261" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> For centuries manumission had been a common act,
the number of freedmen in Rome being notoriously great at all times,
from the day of Cicero onwards. It was almost a matter of course for a
Roman master to free a multitude of his slaves on his deathbed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>or by his will, till Augustus enacted that no
one should emancipate more than a hundred at once. A diligent slave, in
fact, could usually count on getting his freedom by five or six years
of service; and many were allowed to buy it out of their savings, or
out of earnings they were permitted to make.</p>
<p class="par">So far were the earlier Christian emperors, with one
exception, from seeking to raise the status of slaves, that they
re-enacted the rule excluding them from the purview of the law against
adultery, &ldquo;because of the vileness of their condition.&rdquo; The
exception was the law of Constantine forbidding the separation of
slaves from their families&mdash;a humane veto disregarded by Christian
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3268" title=
"Source: slaveowners">slave-owners</span> in modern times. But
Constantine, on the other hand, enacted that if a freewoman should
cohabit with a slave, she should be executed, and he burned alive; and
the laws against fugitive slaves were made more cruel. Gratian even
enacted that any slave who dared to accuse his master of any crime,
unless it were high treason, should be burned alive, without any
inquiry into the charge. For the rest, the Fathers justified slavery on
the score of the curse passed on Ham; and the theses of the Stoics as
to the natural equality of men had from them no countenance.</p>
<p class="par">Only in the reign of Justinian did the law begin
expressly to encourage manumission, to recognize freedmen as full
citizens, and to raise the slave status; and several circumstances are
to be noted as giving a lead to such a course. Justinian had pursued a
policy of great outlays where his immediate predecessors had been
frugal, and to sustain it he had to impose much fresh taxation on the
land. For fiscal purposes, it had long been recognized, the government
did well to limit the power of proprietors to dispose of their slaves;
and it is probable that the humane law of Constantine really had this
end in view. By raising slaves to the status of half-free peasants, the
State increased the number of its taxpayers. &ldquo;The labourer of the
soil then became an object of great interest to the treasury, and
obtained almost as important a position in the eyes of the fisc as the
landed proprietor himself.&rdquo; In the process the small freeman was
put in a worse position than before; but the slave was at the same time
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>bettered&mdash;the hereditary slave, that is,
for captives were enslaved or bought throughout the history of the
Byzantine empire.</p>
<p class="par">The legal change was thus made from economic motives;
but one moral gain did indirectly accrue from the existence of the
Church as such. Under Justinian the empire was re-expanded after having
been for a time curtailed; and this would under paganism have meant a
large addition to the number of slaves. The recovered lands, however,
were peopled by Christians; and all bishops were bound in their own
interest to resist the enslavement and deportation of their flocks; so
that Christianity at this point was favourable to freedom exactly as
was Islam, which forbade Moslems to enslave Moslems. And the indirect
benefit did not end there. The Church, like the fisc, had a good deal
to gain pecuniarily from the freeing of slaves; and, especially in the
West, though it supported slave-laws, it encouraged masters to manumit
for the sake of their souls&rsquo; welfare in the next world. That the
motive here again was political and not doctrinal is clear from the two
facts&mdash;(1) that even when making serfs priests for its own service
the Church often did not legally free them, thus keeping them more
fully subject to discipline; and (2) that while urging laymen to free
the slaves or serfs on their lands Churchmen were the last to free
those on their own, on the score that no individuals in orders had the
right to alienate the property of the order as such. Other economic
causes, of course, effectually concurred to further the freeing of
slaves and serfs, else the institution would not have decayed as it did
in the Middle Ages. It is noteworthy, too, that while the Jews were the
great slave dealers for Europe in the Dark Ages, thus dangerously
deepening their own unpopularity and moving the Church to thwart the
traffic on Christian grounds, Christians everywhere were long eager to
buy and sell barbarians such as the Slavs (from whose name came the
very term &ldquo;slave&rdquo; in the modern languages); while the
Christian Anglo-Saxons and Anglo-Normans for centuries maintained a
trade in kidnapped Anglo-Saxon or British children and young women,
selling them to Ireland after they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217"
href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>were no longer saleable on
the continent. A similar traffic went on among the Bohemians, before
the eyes of St. Adalbert. What the Church did, broadly speaking, was to
restrain the enslavement of Christians by their fellows; and to raise
funds to redeem Christian captives from the Saracens. To a certain
extent the motive was religious: otherwise it was self-regarding.</p>
<p class="par">In similarly indirect ways, organized Christianity
tended at times to restrain feudal tyranny. The bishop and the abbot
were territorial magnates, who to some extent counterpoised the baron;
and though the bishops were too often only barons with a difference,
they were often a barrier to lay ambition and violence. Even as the
king&rsquo;s rule might protect the common people as against their
local lords&mdash;though the feudal system did not originally suppose
this&mdash;so the Church might be a local benefactor in virtue of its
local interests. Here again, however, the influence was not doctrinal;
and Churchmen in general endorsed the feudal law in letter and in
spirit, always availing themselves of its machinery to extort their own
dues.</p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, insofar as the papacy in the twelfth
century began to throw its weight on the side of the popular party in
Italy as against the aristocratic and imperial party, thus constituting
the Guelph faction as against the Ghibeline, it indirectly furthered
the cause of self-government; and even in its official doctrine there
thus came to be inserted provisions in favour of the claim of subjects
to choose their rulers. The teaching of Thomas Aquinas to this effect
must have counted for something in the later evolution of political
doctrine. Nothing however is more remarkable than the ease with which
dutiful kings, as those of later Spain and France, secured the assent
of the Church, as the early barbarian kings had done, to the
suppression of all popular liberties. The economic or administrative
interest of the Church was always the determinant of its action. It
supplied no fixed principle conducive to peace; on the contrary, it was
always a force the more for war in Europe. <span class=

the Crusades</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">That some social gains may be correlative with
great historic evils is perhaps best seen in the case of the Crusades
organized by the Church against the Saracens in Palestine. These
campaigns were first conceived in the interests of the papal power; and
as early as 999 Pope Sylvester II (Gerbert), who had been anti-papal
before his elevation, sent a letter through Europe appealing for united
action on behalf of the Church of Jerusalem. There was no response. In
1074 Gregory VII strove hard to the same end, seeing in a conquest of
the Turks a means to extend his power over the Eastern Church. Not,
however, till Europe was full of tales of the cruelties wrought by the
new Eastern power, the Turks, against Christian pilgrims&mdash;a marked
change from the comparative tolerance of the Caliphs&mdash;was it
possible to begin a vast crusading movement among all classes, aiming
at the recovery of the empty sepulchre from which the Christ had risen.
To this movement Pope Urban II zealously lent himself, backing up the
wild appeal of Peter the Hermit (1094) with the fatal bribe of
indulgences.</p>
<p class="par">The first effect (1096) was to collect several immense
and almost formless mobs of men and women who by all accounts were in
the main the refuse of Europe. &ldquo;That the vast majority looked
upon their vow as a licence for the commission of any sin there can be
no moral doubt.&rdquo; The devout exaltation of the few was submerged
by the riot of the many, who began using their indulgences when they
began their march, and rolled like a flood across Europe, massacring,
torturing, and plundering Jews wherever they found them, and forcibly
helping themselves to food where plunder was easy. Multitudes perished
by the way; multitudes more were sold as slaves in Byzantium to pay for
the feeding of the rest there; and of the seven thousand who reached
Asiatic soil with Peter the Hermit, four thousand were slain by the
Turks at Nic&aelig;a; some 300,000 thus perishing in all. Inasmuch as
Europe was thus rid of a mass of its worst inhabitants, the first
crusade might be said so far to have wrought <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>indirect good; but the claim is hardly one to be
pushed on religious grounds.</p>
<p class="par">The more organized military forces who soon followed
under Godfrey of Bouillon and other leaders, though morally not better
witnesses to Christianity, achieved at length (1099) the capture of
Jerusalem, and founded the Latin kingdom of Palestine, which subsisted
in force for less than a hundred years, and in a nominal form for a
century longer. As a display of Christian against &ldquo;pagan&rdquo;
life and conduct, the process of conquest was worse than anything seen
in the East in the Christian era. No armies were ever more licentious
than those of &ldquo;the cross&rdquo;; and those of Attila were hardly
more ferocious. Their own lives were lost in myriads, by the sword, by
disease, and by debauchery; they were divided by mutual hatred from
first to last; and the one force to unify them was the hatred against
the infidel which wreaked itself in the massacre of men, women, and
children after the capture of a city. Besieging Antioch, they shot
heads of hundreds of slain Turks into the city from their engines, and
dug up hundreds of corpses to put the heads on pikes. It is even
recorded that when their savage improvidence left them starving at the
siege of Marra they fed on the corpses they dug up; and when the place
was stormed Bohemond gave up to the general massacre even those
inhabitants who had paid him large sums for their lives, sparing only
the young, whom he sent to the slave-markets of Antioch. When Godfrey
took Jerusalem, the Jews there were all burned alive in their
synagogues; and the chronicles tell that the crusaders rode their
horses to the temple knee-deep in the blood of many thousands of slain
misbelievers. On the second day, in cold blood, there was wrought a
fresh massacre by way of solemn sacrifice; and in the name of Jesus
were slain a great multitude of every age&mdash;mothers with the
infants in their arms, little children, youths and maidens, and men and
women bowed with age. Thus was retrieved the mythic Saviour&rsquo;s
sepulchre.</p>
<p class="par">Eight times, during two hundred years, was the effort
repeated, as the fortunes of the Christian principalities in the East
were shaken or overthrown by Moslem assailants, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>and
as the papacy saw its chance or need to weaken the emperor, or
otherwise avert danger to itself, by renewing the call to arms. No
religious teacher seems ever to have doubted the fitness of the
undertaking. St. Bernard preached the second Crusade as zealously as
Peter did the first; eloquent monks were found, as they were needed, to
rouse enthusiasm for each of the rest in turn; and King Louis IX of
France, the model monarch of Christendom, saw in his vain expedition to
recover Jerusalem (1248) the highest service he could do to God or man.
As each successive crusade failed in the act or was followed by
decadence and defeat, the Church professed to see in the disaster a
penalty for Christian sin; and under Innocent III the very cardinals of
Rome vowed to mend their ways, by way of reviving the warlike zeal of
the laity. Among other fruits of the crusading movement had been a vast
increase in the papal revenues; and whereas the imposts specially laid
on for crusading purposes were said by many to have been appropriated
by the papal court, the pope undertook to put the administration of all
such revenue under non-clerical trustees. But between the hardness of
the military task and the endless strifes and degeneracies of the
leaders on the one hand, and the growing distrust of the Church on the
other, the crusading spirit died out in the thirteenth century.</p>
<p class="par">To all who could sanely judge, it had become clear that
the crusades were at once a vast drain on the blood and treasure of
Europe and a vast force of demoralization. In the course of the fifth,
the government of Venice succeeded in using the crusaders, in despite
of the protests of Innocent III, to wrest the city of Zara from the
king of Hungary, himself a zealous crusader. Then the expedition, with
the pope&rsquo;s approval, proceeded to interfere in Byzantine strifes,
making and unmaking emperors, until they had created chaos, whereupon
they sacked Constantinople (1204) with every circumstance of vileness
and violence. The pope, who had hoped to reconcile the Byzantines to
papal rule, burst out in bitter indignation at the deeds of the men to
whom he had given his indulgences; but morality was at an end all
round, as might have been foretold; and the pope accepted the conquest
for what it was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221"
name="pb221">221</a>]</span>to bring him in new power. Christendom
thenceforth crusaded with its tongue in its cheek. From the first the
papacy had taught that no faith need be kept with unbelievers; and so
was given a very superfluous apprenticeship to bad faith between
Christians. When in 1212 there broke out the hapless Children&rsquo;s
Crusades, out of the 30,000 who followed the boy Stephen some way
through France, 5,000 were shipped at Marseilles by merchants who,
professing to carry them &ldquo;for the cause of God, and without
charge,&rdquo; sold them as slaves at Algiers and Alexandria. The last
recruits furnished by pope Nicholas IV to the Grand Master of the
Templars were drawn from the jails of Italy: the papacy itself had
ceased to put any heart in the struggle. It is a reasonable calculation
that in the two centuries from the first crusade to the fall of Acre
(1291) there had perished, in the attempts to recover and hold the Holy
Land, nine millions of human beings, at least half of them Christians.
Misery and chronic pestilence had slain most; but the mere carnage had
been stupendous.</p>
<p class="par">Much has been written as to the gains to civilization
from the &ldquo;intercourse&rdquo; thus set up between West and East.
Gains there were; and if we remember that thus to have gained was the
measure of the incapacity of Christendom for peaceful traffic with the
world of Islam, we can learn from the process something of real
sociological causation. Men who, from ferocity and fanaticism, could
not make quiet acquaintance with their neighbours, were hurled against
them in furious hordes, generation after generation, and in the
intervals of fighting came to know something of their arts and their
thought, exchanging handicrafts and products. The crowning irony of the
evolution lay in the entrance of unbelief into the Christian world
through the very contact with the &ldquo;infidel&rdquo; who was to have
been crushed. This perhaps was the discovery that disillusioned the
papacy. And but for the spirit of faith and hate&mdash;the true
correlatives in Christian history&mdash;every gain from the Crusades
might have been made ten times over in commerce. To make such gains at
the price of nine million lives and unutterable evil is the
contribution of the Crusades to civilization. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It is true that from the East the later crusaders
learned what chivalry they evolved; that Saladin became a kind of model
hero for Christian knights; and that he could hold knightly friendship
with Richard of England. But Richard nevertheless could massacre two
thousand hostages in cold blood for an unpaid debt; and his crusading
left him as it found him, a faithless ruffian, whom to honour is to be
cheated by a romance. Nor did passages of chivalry ever root out of
crusaders&rsquo; hearts the creed that no faith need be kept with a
misbeliever.</p>
<p class="par">It is true again that the Crusades involved much social
metabolism in Europe. The papal indulgence freed serfs from their
masters, and debtors from their usurers, while the crusade lasted; the
crusading barons freed many more serfs for a price down, and sold broad
lands to middle-class buyers in order to furnish themselves for the
campaign. And the mere stir of the exodus and the return, repeated for
so many generations, was a vivifying shock to the torpor of medieval
Europe, where war was for many the one relief to a vast tedium. But the
torpor must go to the credit of the creed if the shock does, since the
faith had vetoed the intercourse of peace; and to the same account must
be put the throwing back upon itself of the Saracen civilization, of
which Christian enmity directly or indirectly wrought the arrest and
ruin, first in the East, later in Spain. Such wreckages surely block
the path of the wrecker. If, finally, we seek to measure the reactions
of crusading savagery on the life of those who wrought and those who
applauded it&mdash;a reaction seldom reckoned in the discussion of the
&ldquo;results&rdquo;&mdash;we shall be well prepared for the discovery
that in the fourteenth century the general lot of men in Europe showed
no betterment; that the tillers of the soil had still to sweat blood
under feudal masters, save where the enormous loss of life through the
pestilence known as the Black Death had for a time raised the price of
labour; and that the institution which above all embodied for Europe
the memory of the Crusades, the Order of the Knights Templars, was at
length crushed in its home by as base a conspiracy and as cruel a
slaughter as ever marked the struggle of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>Christian with
Mohammedan. It was pretended by Philip the Fair of France, who began
the plot, that the Order was anti-Christian, and devoted to blasphemous
rites; but there is no proof of the occurrence of anything more than
irregular acts of irreverence, answering to the artistic ribaldries of
the mason-companies who built the cathedrals. That phenomenon is in
itself noteworthy, as showing how the Crusades had tended to shake
faith; but the Templars as a whole were no more unbelievers than the
kings who coveted their wealth. It was for that wealth, which was
indeed incongruously great, that they were conspired against by their
fellow Christians, who in two hundred years of a precarious union of
enmity against men of another faith had not learned goodwill towards
those of their own. The drama ended as it began, in hatred and crime.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">&sect; 1.</span> <i>Superstition
and Intolerance</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In judging of the intellectual life of the Middle
Ages, account must always be taken of the fact that their earlier
literature is mainly religious and ecclesiastical, and that such
literature often gives a very faint idea of the higher mental life of
the educated laity. In our own time, and still more in the last two
centuries, the literature of devotion and of the Church seldom suggests
the play of intelligence that actually goes on in the world: taken by
itself, indeed, it would often imply intellectual decline. As we have
seen and shall see, the Middle Ages had an intellectual life apart from
the Church; and in the period we term the Renaissance that life was
far-reaching; there is reason therefore to question whether at a time
when authors were mostly clerics there was not some sane thinking of
which we read little or nothing. But even if such allowance be made,
the fact remains that the period of clerical supremacy in literature is
a period of enormous superstition.</p>
<p class="par">Under that term even religious people now include a
habitual belief in diabolical agency, a constant affirmation of
miracles, portents, divine and fiendish apparitions; and the Protestant
adds to the definition saint-worship, belief in the supernatural virtue
of relics, and the acceptance of the daily miracle of
transubstantiation. But even if questions of doctrine be put aside, we
may sum up that the average Christian in the Middle Ages was more
credulous as to daily prodigies, saintly and fiendish, than even the
average Catholic peasant of to-day in the more backward European
countries. Doubters and unbelievers there must always have been; but in
the medieval period it was dangerous to utter doubt, unless by way of
attack on priests and monks in circles where they were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>not
popular. Ribald doubt, besides, came off best; grave disbelief incurred
suspicion; and where men cannot speak their thought they are hindered
in their thinking. The most unseemly debates, such as that as to
whether the eucharist when eaten passed through the normal process of
digestion (&ldquo;stercoranism&rdquo; was the name given to the heresy
that it did), and that set up by Ratramnus as to how the impregnation
of the Virgin actually took place&mdash;such discussions could go on
freely; but more decent controversy could not. Beyond question, the
influence of clerical literature was mainly for gross credulity. The
lives of the saints in general, from Gregory I onwards, tell constantly
of a puerility of judgment which to a Periclean Greek would have been
inconceivable, and which was incompatible not only with rational
thought but with tolerable veracity. Language and the art of writing
had become means of destroying common sense. In the hands of the
hagiographers, the use of miracle so far outgoes the older tradition
that it must have finally failed to suggest anything divine&mdash;even
to a believer. To a skeptic it suggests burlesque.</p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, medieval life was in the main as much
ridden by fear of evil spirits as that of any savages of our own time;
for every people had kept the notion of their hostile sprites, and the
Christian devil was simply made the God of that kingdom. Life, too, was
shorter than moderns can well realize; so high was the normal
death-rate, so frequent was pestilence, so little understood was
disease; and the nearness of death made men either reckless or afraid.
Where ignorance and fear go hand in hand, is the realm of superstition.
Average religion was summed up in a perfectly superstitious use of the
sacraments of baptism and the eucharist; a devout hope in the
intercession and protection of the saints; an ever-present fear of the
activity of the fiend; a singularly mechanical use of formularies; an
intense anxiety to possess or benefit by holy relics, the easy
manufacture of which must have enriched myriads; a chronic fear of
sorcery; and a conception of hell and purgatory so literal that its
general failure to amend or control conduct is a revelation of the
inconsequence of average morality. It is often hard to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>distinguish in medieval religion between
devotional and criminal motives. In the life of the Italian St. Romuald
(tenth century) it is told that when he insisted on leaving the retreat
in Catalonia where he had won a saintly repute, the Catalans proposed
to kill him in order to possess his relics. He in turn cudgelled his
father nearly to death to make him adhere to his profession of the
religious life. Such ethical ideas expressed themselves in the monastic
caste not only in austerities but in systematic self-flagellation; and
in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries the principle
evolved the chronic movements of the Flagellants, specially so-called,
whose wild and public self-tortures neither Church nor State could put
down while the mania lasted.</p>
<p class="par">In such a world, primed by a great caste of priests,
intolerance had its ideal habitat. Aversion to innovating thought is as
natural to man as egoism; and an innovating religion is no sooner
established than it finds equilibrium in denouncing innovation. Thus,
even apart from clerical action, and apart too from the ethnic
animosity to Mohammedanism, the medieval laity, knowing nothing of the
long intellectual and sectarian struggles which have forced tolerance
on modern polity, were spontaneous persecutors of heresy save where it
appealed primarily to their anti-clerical economic interests, or
carried them away by mere contagion of physical excitement. The
Flagellants, for instance, seem positively to have hypnotized many by
their procedure, as did the partly kindred and partly contrary sect of
Dancers, who flourished in Flanders and Germany late in the fourteenth
century. It is thus credible that some were cured by incantations,
which were hypnotic with a difference. But all such eccentrics were
normally liable to cruel ill-treatment from their conforming fellows;
and it is clear that in the fourteenth century the mystical and
communistic heresies of Beghards and Beguins, male and female, were
promptly persecuted by the general laity. The religion which
categorically taught men to love their enemies never seems to have
prepared them to endure in their neighbours a difference of
doctrine.</p>
<p class="par">It is probable, too, that during the Dark Ages thousands
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>of helpless souls were put to death as sorcerers
by mobs without process of law, apart from those executed under the old
laws against magic or divination, and the Teutonic codes of the same
order. In a similar spirit, Christian mobs in all countries and ages
had chronically wreaked a half-religious, half-economic hatred on the
Jews, of whom enormous numbers died by massacre. Here the motive was
not wholly religious, since their unfortunate specialization in
usury&mdash;albeit forced upon them by Christian
exclusiveness&mdash;had set up ill-will against the Jews in the period
of the pagan empire, and even among the Moors, who had given them
religious toleration. But Christian animus certainly counted for much,
and carried the passion to lengths rarely reached in antiquity. Thus
the common run of Christian life was grossly intolerant. It was left to
the Church as such, however, to frame for the suppression of free
thought in religion a machinery never paralleled in human history.</p>

Inquisition</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Though all the heresy hunts of the ancient Church
had implied an inquisitorial ideal, nothing in the nature of a
&ldquo;Holy Office&rdquo; had existed in the Church till the second
quarter of the thirteenth century. It was felt that the faithful could
as a rule be trusted to raise the cry of heresy wherever it could be
scented. Such prompt action we have seen taken in the cases of
Jovinian, Pelagius, Gottschalk, and Berengar. But in the twelfth
century the spirit of militant orthodoxy, as seen in zealots like St.
Bernard, had reached a strength which pointed to some systematic action
on the part of the now much aggrandized papacy. St. Bernard&rsquo;s
attitude to Abailard is that of the true Inquisitor: he suspects, to
begin with, the accursed spirit of independent thought, and he is
straightway determined to make an example of the upstart who dares to
reason on all doctrines for himself. But even St. Bernard, eager as he
was for the blood of Moslems, could hardly have anticipated the spirit
in which the papacy acted from the Albigensian crusade onwards.
Coincident with that crusade was the digging up of Amalrich&rsquo;s
bones, the burning of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href=
"#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>followers, and the veto on the
study of Aristotle at Paris. Intolerance had entered on a new era.</p>
<p class="par">The first steps towards a systematic and centralized
Inquisition were taken about 1178, when, under Pope Alexander III, the
Church began moving against the &ldquo;Manichean&rdquo; heretics of
Languedoc. A papal legate at that time forced from the Count of
Toulouse and his nobles a promise on oath to resist heresy; and in a
council of the following year orthodox princes in general were invited
to use force for the purpose. The pope proceeded not only to
excommunicate the heretics and their backers but to declare, in the
fashion already consecrated by the Crusades, that no one need keep
faith with them; further offering indulgences for two years to all who
should make war on them, and calling on their lords to reduce them to
slavery. As a result, a crusade was made in 1181, so little marked by
bloodshed as to be insignificant in comparison with those of the next
generation, but sufficient to force an abjuration of heresy from the
lords concerned. Thereafter, in 1184, a Council held at Verona
prescribed with a new precision and emphasis a systematic search for
heresy by all bishops, and called upon the nobles to lend their support
in the way of the necessary violence. Innocent III had thus had the way
marked out for him, alike in suppression and in prevention; and the
Inquisition as such dates from the close of his crusade against the
Albigenses, when Pope Gregory IX took from the bishops the business of
heresy-hunting and made it a special task of the Dominican order
(1233). After &ldquo;Manich&aelig;ism&rdquo; had been stamped out there
was a lull in persecution as in heresy; but the institution remained,
to prevent new growths.</p>
<p class="par">The broad outcome of its work was that whereas the
twelfth century had been one of intellectual dawn, and the thirteenth,
despite its murderous beginning, one of diffusion of light, the
fourteenth was on the whole one of stationary knowledge, save in Italy
itself, where the growing energies of the Renaissance for the time
eluded repression. Indeed the Church cared little about mere unbelief,
as distinct from anti-clerical heresy, where its political rule was not
thereby <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>affected; and in Italy, when anti-clericalism
was once put down, its wealth made it secure. Even in Italy the
literary life of the fourteenth century was rather artistic than
intellectual, science and serious thought making little progress; while
in northern Europe they were visibly arrested. It was in the outlying
States, where heresy might mean a cessation of papal revenue, that the
Dominicans were specially hounded on to their work. In England, in the
latter part of the thirteenth century, the great spirit of Roger Bacon
was cabined and confined by inquisitorial enmities; and in France in
the fourteenth there was a signal suspension of intellectual life, in
the face of the activities of original thinkers such as William of
Occam. The throttling of the civilization of the south had reacted on
the north. Doubtless the desperate wars to which crusading experience
had given a new incitement counted for much, and the constant political
intrigues of the papacy for more, in arresting mental growth.
&ldquo;When a city for any political proceeding had given offence to
its political head, emperor or king, or had irritated a Roman bishop by
opposition, the usual punishment, by command or interdict, was to
inhibit its professors from teaching, and to disperse its
scholars.&rdquo; All the political causes wrought together for the
hindrance of human advancement. The immense destruction of population
by the Black Death, finally, was a great incitement to
superstition.</p>
<p class="par">The main effect of the Inquisition is seen in Spain,
which in the Saracen period had been one of the great sources of new
thought and knowledge. There, despite the element of intellectual
curiosity set up in the period of Moorish supremacy, when the
Christians were in general treated with tolerance, the spirit of
fanaticism was in some measure ingrained by the long struggle between
Christians and Moslems for the land, though there were also contrary
developments; and an inquisitorial war on Jewish and Moorish ideas was
part of the Christian campaign. As the Christians gained ground,
ecclesiasticism gained with them; yet when the Inquisition, not yet a
permanent Spanish tribunal, was set up in Spain in 1236, it was
received by a large part of the population with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>fear
and dislike. It is an error to suppose that there was something in
&ldquo;Spanish character&rdquo; specially prone to the methods of the
Inquisition. Spanish orthodoxy is a manufactured product, and
represents the triumph, under special conditions, of the fanatical
element which belongs to every nation. Not only did many eminent
Spaniards detest and denounce the Inquisition in its first and
imperfectly destructive form: the common people rioted against it when,
in its permanent and more murderous form, it was constituted in
1478&ndash;83, and put under Torquemada. That memorable persecutor long
felt his life to be in danger from the people, both in Aragon and in
Castile; and the first inquisitor-general of Aragon was actually killed
by them.</p>
<p class="par">Yet even the &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; Inquisition had been
fatally successful. In the two centuries from its establishment, while
Averroism was rife in Italy and France, Christian Spain must have been
well nigh rid of the other forms of heretical thought; and the first
step of Ferdinand and Isabella after their crowning triumph was to
expel all Jews who would not apostatize. On the remaining Moors the New
Inquisition went to work in a similar spirit, persecuting them,
baptizing them by force, burning their books, and driving them
repeatedly to revolts, which were always murderously put down. Finally,
after the failure of the great Armada against England, the Inquisitors
decided that the cause of the divine wrath was their undue toleration
of heresy, and a million of nonconforming Moriscoes were miserably
driven out of Spain, as a hundred and sixty thousand Jews had been a
century before.</p>
<p class="par">As all civilization lives by the play of intellectual
variation, Spain was now stripped of a large part of her mental as well
as her material resources; and the continued work of the Inquisition at
length clinched the arrest of her brilliant literature for centuries,
keeping her devoid of science while the rest of Europe was gathering
it. In introducing the Inquisition the Church had destroyed the
specific civilization of southern France, thereby laming that of
northern France; and in thereafter applying the machine to the
civilization of Spain she reduced that to inanition. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It should be remembered that the Inquisition&rsquo;s
purpose was to destroy books no less than men; and until printing
overpowered the effort, the check thus put on the spread of rational
thought bade fair to be fatal. In a single <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i>
(&ldquo;act of faith&rdquo;) at Salamanca, near the end of the
fifteenth century, six thousand volumes were burned, on the pretence
that they contained Judaic errors, or were concerned with magic and
witchcraft. It is certain that many of them were of another character.
Elsewhere the work of destruction was less ostentatiously done, but it
was constant.</p>
<p class="par">In the matter of torture and slaughter, however, the
work of the Inquisition has become a proverb; and after all corrections
have been made on the earlier estimates by Llorente and other
historians, the figures remain frightful. In &ldquo;a few years&rdquo;
the New Inquisition burned alive, in Castile alone, nearly two thousand
persons, and variously penalized some twenty thousand more. At this
rate, many thousands must have been burned in a generation; and the
statement that nearly two hundred thousand passed through the Spanish
Inquisition&rsquo;s hands in thirty-six years is sadly credible. Its
methods were the negation of every principle of justice. Any evidence,
including that of criminals, children, and even idiots, was valid
against an accused person, while only that of the most unimpeachable
kind was heard in his favour; all proceedings were strictly private;
false informers were almost never punished; and the general principle
was that anyone who was tried must be somehow guilty, the Inquisition
being like the pope infallible. Thus, if a man could not be convicted
of real heresy, he could be punished for an error in the repetition of
a prayer or a creed. But the torture-chamber can seldom have failed to
yield whatever proof was sought for. No such reign of terror and horror
has occurred in any other period of European history; and only in the
practices of witch-finders among savages can its systematic atrocity be
anywhere paralleled.</p>

Survivals and Saracen Contacts</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ancient literature, as we have seen, was nearing
its nadir <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>when Christianity was becoming supreme in the
decadent Roman Empire; and with the formal extinction of classic
paganism came the virtual extinction of fine letters, science, and
philosophy, in the Byzantine State no less than in the West. The last
Christian writers of any philosophic importance were really products of
classic culture and the ancient civilization. When that civilization
had been outwardly transformed to a Christian guise, the mental life
shrank to the field of theology, with a few fenced and meagre plots of
scholastic drilling-ground. Of the decayed discipline of ancient
culture Christian civilization preserved only the most mechanical
formulas; and the mental training of the Dark Ages consisted in a few
handbooks (notably those by Martianus Capella and Cassiodorus) of what
was then encyclopedic knowledge&mdash;the rules of Latin grammar,
dialectics or elementary logic, rhetoric, music, arithmetic, elementary
geometry, and some traditional astronomy. The first three constituted
the trivium or introductory course in the medieval schools; the others
the quadrivium: together &ldquo;the seven liberal arts.&rdquo; The
larger Encyclopedia of Isidore of Seville, the standard authority for
centuries, is as mechanical, as devoid of living thought, as empty of
scientific knowledge, as any of the others. In the way of literature,
there was left to most Westerns little beyond a few of the later Latin
writers, such as Boethius, who could pass muster as being Christians.
Gregory the Great had set the note of theological anathema against the
pagan poets and philosophers; and classic history survived only in bad
abstracts.</p>
<p class="par">Wherever in the Dark Ages we meet with any power of
thought, it is to be traced either to the influence of Saracen contacts
or, as in John Scotus, to the Greek scholarship that had been preserved
in Ireland while the western empire was being dissolved in barbarism.
The English Alcuin, who had loyally aided Charlemagne in his efforts to
spread education in the new &ldquo;Holy Roman&rdquo; empire, got his
culture in an atmosphere where that influence had partly survived.
Beyond this, the Latin world had preserved from the past, in the law
schools which never wholly died out in Italy, a professional knowledge
of the Justinian code, which the Lombards and Franks had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>allowed to subsist for those who claimed to be
judged by it, and which remained the proper law of the papal territory
after Charlemagne. In the sphere of such special knowledge, though it
was strictly monopolized, there was doubtless an intellectual life
largely independent of religion; and there some classical culture
probably always flourished.</p>
<p class="par">The first effectual movements of new mental life,
however, come from contact with the Saracens of Spain. While the
Byzantine world let the treasures of old Greek knowledge fall from its
hands, the Mohammedans in the East early acquired, at first through the
Nestorian Christians, some knowledge of Aristotle and of Greek
mathematics, medicine, and astronomy; and this in the progressive
Saracen period was passed on to the Moors of Spain. Thence came into
the Latin world the beginnings of science, as anciently known, with the
beginnings of chemistry, an Arab creation. After the period of John
Scotus, all culture had for centuries decayed: the few who cared to
read were monks, taught to hold pagan lore in horror; so that at the
end of the ninth century even such schooling as the trivium and
quadrivium was rare in what had been the realm of Charlemagne; and the
later manuals, such as that of St. Remi, were even more puerile than
the older. Only from new culture-contacts could new culture arise.</p>
<p class="par">One of the most fruitful impulses to such life was the
introduction, late in the tenth century, by Gerbert, afterwards Pope
Sylvester II, of an intermediate form of the Arabic notation, making
possible the decimal method. Gerbert had acquired in his youthful
sojourn on the Spanish march&mdash;not among the Moors, as the
tradition has it&mdash;some knowledge of Arab mathematics and of the
logic of Aristotle; and where his predecessors in the cathedral school
at Rheims had for the most part shunned the Latin classics, he used
them freely in teaching rhetoric. But the impulse he gave to the
science of number, so vital alike for astronomy and for chemistry, was
his greatest practical service. Those who used his method of
calculating were called Gerbertists; and in that still dark age even
such knowledge as his gave rise to the belief that he had dealings with
the devil. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The new life was slow to take root; and when in the
eleventh century the English monk Adelhard translated from the Arabic,
which he had learned in his travels in Spain and Egypt, the Elements of
Euclid, he found little welcome for it. Not till a century later did a
fresh translation of Euclid from the Arabic, by Campanus, make its way
in the schools. Algebra came from the same source, through a travelling
merchant of Pisa, about the beginning of the thirteenth century.
Thenceforth the infant sciences of physics held their ground, and from
those beginnings became possible the lore of Roger Bacon. A genuine
scientific spirit indeed was slow to grow; the ideals and ethics of
religion had almost atrophied among Christians the instinct for simple
truth; but the passion for astrology promoted astronomy, and the
passion for gold promoted chemistry, all its practitioners hoping for
the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, which should transmute lead into gold.
Always it is from the Arabs that the impulse comes. Under the emperor
Frederick II, who in his Sicilian seat gave free course to Saracen
culture and thought, was first translated from the Arabic the Greek
Ptolemy&rsquo;s great work on astronomy; and for Alphonso X of Castile,
by Moorish means, were compiled new astronomical tables. From the
Arabs, too, came trigonometry, which even for the Greeks had not been a
separate science; and only in the fifteenth century did M&uuml;ller of
K&ouml;nigsberg (&ldquo;Regiomontanus&rdquo;), who perfected the
decimal notation, first give it new developments.</p>
<p class="par">New philosophic thought came by the same paths. Between
the philosophy of the Arab Averro&euml;s, with its Aristotelian basis
and its lead to pantheism and materialism on the one hand, and the
moral reaction set up by the Crusades on the other, the bases of
Christian orthodoxy were shaken. The legend that Frederick II wrote a
treatise entitled <i>The Three Impostors</i>, dealing with Moses,
Jesus, and Mohammed, is a fable; there was probably no such book in the
Middle Ages, for it would have meant death at the hands of the
Inquisition to possess it; but the very phrase showed what men had
become capable of thinking and saying.</p>
<p class="par">As the Renaissance proceeded in Italy in the teeth of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>strifes which ultimately destroyed Italian
liberty, men turned with all the zest of new intelligence to the
remains of Latin literature. Virgil had become for the Middle Ages a
beneficent magician, a kind of classic Merlin, and as such he is framed
by Dante in his great poem of the other world. Religion in Italy had
been brought into something like contempt by the lives and deeds of its
ministers; and only in the literature of civilized antiquity could
intellectual men find at once stimulus and satisfaction. It is to be
said for the popes and cardinals of Rome, now among the wealthiest
princes of Christendom, that they too promoted the revival of learning
by their rewards. On their urging, scholars retrieved classics from the
garrets and cellars of a hundred monasteries, or from the scrolls from
which they had been partly obliterated to make way for a theology that
the scholars despised. Popes and cardinals themselves, indeed, were
commonly held in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to care little
about theology and to know less&mdash;a state of things which
ultimately aided their heretical adversaries, as did the scholarship
they helped to spread.</p>
<p class="par">With the fall of Constantinople came the final decisive
impulse to new culture in western Europe. Ecclesiastical hates, and
those aroused by the crusading conquest of Byzantium, had for centuries
sundered the Greek and Latin worlds more completely than even those of
Christian Europe and Islam, setting up a Chinese wall where paganism,
albeit by fatal means, had effected mutual intercourse. But on the
capture of Constantinople by the Turks in 1452 numbers of despairing
Greek scholars sought refuge in the West, and were eagerly welcomed by
students who desired Greek, not to acquire the theology of the
Byzantines, but to read in the original the great pagan masters.
Thenceforth the forces of culture in Europe became too strong for the
forces of repression. It was thus by a return to the thought and
science of buried paganism that Christian civilization so-called was
put on a progressive footing. So long as Aristotle, known through Latin
translations made from the Arabic, was a university text-book for
students of theology under ecclesiastical supervision, he was but a
modified instrument of dogmatism; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>his limitations were
made the measure of knowledge even as the Bible had been. With the free
return to the recovered lore of free Greece came a new spirit of
freedom, destined to break down the reign of all dogmatisms, and to
build up a lore of its own.</p>

Art</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On one line, happily, the Church of the
Renaissance was able to do a service to civilization while following
its own ends. Among the apophthegms which stand critical tests is that
to the effect that art has always been the handmaid of religion. So
true is it that even Protestant Christianity, which at its start set
its face against all pictorial expression of religious ideas, is in our
own time visibly much indebted to art for the preservation and
cultivation of religious sentiment.</p>
<p class="par">In antiquity, save in the anti-idolatrous cults,
religion had been the great patron of imitative art, inasmuch as it
made the most constant economic demand for sculptures and paintings.
This law held good from Hindostan to Rome; and even Judaism and
Mazdeism had perforce to subsidize architecture. That common need for
splendid temples preserved architectural ideals in Byzantium when the
art of the higher sculpture had utterly disappeared; and as the loss of
skill in sculpture, no less than the old aversion to statues as symbols
of paganism, prevented activity on that line, the Byzantines devoted
themselves to the carving and painting of wooden icons, and to mosaics,
pictures, and manuscript illuminations, for religious purposes. The
results were constrained and unprogressive; but hence, in the Dark
Ages, and during the short-lived Latin empire of Constantinople, came
the models for the first pictorial art of Italy; and from that
beginning, under the economic encouragement given by a priesthood whose
wealth was always increasing, and whose churches and palaces constantly
gained in splendour, came the immense artistic flowering of the
Renaissance. After the Reformation had cut off half the sources of
Italian ecclesiastical wealth, and Spanish rule had begun to ruin
industry, the artistic life of Italy rapidly died away; even as in
Protestant Holland, where the economic <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>demand was
non-clerical, coming mainly from a wealthy trading class who sought
portraits and secular pictures, there was a rapid decline from the
period of political and economic contraction.</p>
<p class="par">It needed, however, the conditions of free civic life,
such as prevailed in the earlier part of the Renaissance, to raise
ecclesiastical art from the bondage of convention in which it had been
kept by the Byzantine Church, as by the priesthood of ancient Egypt. It
was the multiform intellectual competition of the Italian States in
their period of free growth, and even under their native despots, that
bred artistic spirits such as those who perpetually widened the bounds
of the arts of colour and form, from Giotto to Michel Angelo and
Titian.</p>
<p class="par">Under equivalent conditions took place the great
evolution of architectural art in France and northern Europe. It was
mainly the economic demand of the Church that evolved the admirable
architecture called &ldquo;Gothic&rdquo;&mdash;a misnomer first applied
by the later artificial taste which could see beauty only in classical
symmetry, and disdained the wild grace and power of the medieval
architecture as mere barbarism. It was really a special development of
artistic faculty. Modern fancy has ascribed to the guilds of
cathedral-builders on the one hand a passion for occult lore, supposed
to be the source of the modern mummery of &ldquo;Freemasonry,&rdquo;
and on the other hand a deep religious feeling, of which the cathedral
is supposed to be the expression. How far this is from the truth may be
gathered from a closer study of their sculptures in many of the older
cathedrals and churches, which reveal not only a riotous irreverence
and indecency, but at times a positive derision for the faith.
Nonetheless, organized Christianity had, by its demand for their work,
provided a wonderful artistic environment for a cult which could no
more than those of antiquity evolve a humanity worthy of beautiful
things. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=

<h2 class="main">BYZANTINE CHRISTIANITY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The history of Christian Byzantium, from the rise
of Islam to the fall of Constantinople, is the typical instance of
mental stagnation. During a period of eight hundred years, even
friendly research professes to discover in Byzantine annals only one
writer&rsquo;s name per century which posterity can be expected to keep
in memory. Such a history is the complete confutation of the common
theory that Christianity is in itself a force of progress; but once
more we must take note that Christianity was not the determining cause
of the arrest. Civilization progresses by the contact of cultures; and
where that is lacking the results are the same under all religious
systems. Byzantium presents the symptoms of China, because, like China,
it was politically and intellectually isolated for a whole era, under a
centralized government which imposed certain norms of life and
doctrine, and prevented the variation and mutual reaction that would
otherwise have arisen between its provinces. Only inasmuch as it
promoted and consecrated such a system was Christianity a primary
factor in the resulting arrest of growth. As a matter of fact, it lent
itself alternately to division and to petrifaction. In the period to
the end of the seventh century, dogma was a source of strife which
dismembered the empire; in the period of contracted empire, face to
face with the Moslem enemy, religious feeling tended to prevent further
disruption, very much as the Church had been unified in the pagan
period by persecution.</p>
<p class="par">Within the contracted empire, however, there was no
durable progress. Its condensed annals give a picture which even the
barbarian West could not outgo. In the period from 668 to 716 seven
emperors were dethroned, four of them were put to death, one (while
drunk) had his eyes put out, and two <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>more, in addition to
two brothers of emperors, had their noses cut off&mdash;punishments
which in Byzantium became classical. Under Christianity there was
certainly more cruelty and demoralization than under early Islam. The
Caliph Aboubekr had given to his followers those injunctions: &ldquo;Be
just: the unjust never prosper. Be valiant: die rather than yield. Be
merciful: slay neither old men, children, nor women. Destroy neither
fruit-trees, grain, nor cattle. Keep your word, even to your
enemies.&rdquo; Only those who refused either to become Moslems or to
pay tribute were to be slain. In that spirit the Caliph Moawyah rebuilt
their Church for the Christians of Edessa. Fifty years later, Justinian
II invaded Armenia, and on driving out the Saracens seized and sold as
slaves the majority of the Christian inhabitants, reducing the richest
parts of the country to desert. And when, after he had been dethroned,
deprived of his nose, and exiled for ten years, he returned to triumph
over his enemies, the Greek populace applauded him with Biblical
quotations as he sat in the circus with his feet on his rivals&rsquo;
necks.</p>
<p class="par">The advent of Leo the Isaurian (716) marks an epoch in
Byzantine history. Acting as head of the Church, the established
function of the eastern emperors, he set himself to check idolatry,
first by ordering that the pictures in the churches should be placed
high enough to prevent the people from kissing them. On this issue the
populace and the lower clergy united against him, to the length of
rebellion; and he in turn made his edicts more stringent. Whatever may
have been his motives, he acted on principles afterwards founded on by
Protestantism; and during a century and a half&mdash;save for a relapse
from 787 to 813, in which the government was sometimes tyrannically
orthodox and sometimes tolerant&mdash;his views were more or less fully
maintained by succeeding rulers. It is interesting to note that, as
repeatedly happened centuries later in the West, a long period of
religious strife through the whole State created a party in favour of
complete tolerance and liberty of conscience. But though they so far
gained ground as to convert the emperor Nicephorus I (802&ndash;811),
who employed some of them in his ministry, and treated both Paulician
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>heretics and rebels with unusual tolerance,
there was no such intellectual life in Byzantium as could long sustain
a tolerant policy. It is a miscalculation to suppose, as some do, that
the triumph of iconoclasm would have meant the regeneration of the
empire. To work regeneration there were needed further forces of
variation, since Islam stagnated without image-worship as Byzantium did
with it.</p>
<p class="par">Leo the Armenian (813&ndash;820), who was averse to
image-worship but desirous of keeping the peace, was forced by the zeal
of the iconoclastic party and the obstinacy of the orthodox to resume
an iconoclastic policy. Under such circumstances numbers of the clergy
became temporizers, leaving to the monks the fanatical defence of
images; and as Leo himself was capable, with the approbation of both
parties, of an act of the grossest treachery toward his enemy the king
of the Bulgarians, it is clear that neither iconoclasm nor
image-worship was raising the plane of morals. Significantly enough, it
was at the beginning of the reign of Michael the Drunkard
(842&ndash;867), who was professedly orthodox, but openly burlesqued
the ceremonies of the Church, that image-worship was definitely
restored under the regency of his fanatical mother, Theodora. The great
majority were weary of the strife, and many of the iconoclasts had come
to the conclusion that relative sanity in religion was not worth
fighting for. For the rest, Michael was finally assassinated, as Leo
the Armenian had been before him.</p>
<p class="par">It was at this period that Photius, the most learned man
of the Dark Ages, became Patriarch of Constantinople, in the teeth of
the opposition of the pope of Rome, who after the formal restoration of
image-worship had been appealed to, as a champion of orthodoxy, for the
decision of some official disputes in the Eastern Church. After his
position was assured, Photius effectually fought the Roman claims,
completing the schism between the Churches; and in his own sphere he
did much for the preservation of learning, and even something for the
cultivation of judgment. In theology, it is admitted by one of another
school, &ldquo;he made use of his own reason and sagacity&rdquo;; and
he is notable, in his period and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241"
href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>place, for having reached the
idea that earthquakes might not be divine portents. But Photius is the
high-water mark of Byzantine intelligence; and no man of equal capacity
and culture seems to have arisen during the six remaining centuries of
the eastern empire.</p>
<p class="par">It is impossible, indeed, to say whether there was not
in Byzantium, behind the official scenes, a higher intellectual life.
It was from Michael II (&ldquo;the Stammerer&rdquo;) that Louis the son
of Charlemagne received (824) the copy of the writings of Dionysius
&ldquo;the Areopagite,&rdquo; from which was made the first Latin
translation; and as this writer had a great influence on John Scotus,
who may even have acquired his first knowledge of him from that very
copy, which he translated afresh, it may be that in Greece also, where
Dionysius was much admired and studied among the monks, there were deep
thinkers whom he stimulated. But whereas even Scotus could reach few in
the West, any higher thought there may have been in the East remained
entirely latent. Learning fared better. After Photius, the East
produced for posterity the important Lexicon of Suidas, which
apparently belongs to the tenth century; and in the twelfth Eustathius
of Thessalonica produced his valuable commentary on Homer. But the
populace in the East was as ignorant and superstitious as that of the
West; and the system of caste occupations or hereditary pursuits made
eastern learning even a less communicable influence than western.</p>
<p class="par">In the political life there were fluctuations; and
though in all ages alike there were dethronements, assassinations, and
mutilations of emperors and of their suspected relatives, the time of
the Basilian dynasty (867&ndash;1057) was one of relative stability,
with even some military glory, and temporary recovery or expansion of
territory, as against Saracens and Bulgarians. Still the sum-total of
each century&rsquo;s life was practically stagnation. Under emperors,
empresses, or eunuchs, the administration was substantially the same.
Alien elements, which might under other conditions have generated new
life, had entered the empire with the Slavonians, whose race, after
occupying Dalmatia and Illyricum at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>wish of Heraclius in
the seventh century, flourished and multiplied, and invaded the
Peloponnesus early in the ninth. The later iconoclastic emperors were
vigorous enough to bring them to submission; but Roman imperialism and
Christian ecclesiasticism between them undid all progressive
influences, just as the policy of militarism and fanaticism finally did
among the Saracens.</p>
<p class="par">The attempts at change, indeed, were many. Conspiracies
were chronic; and when one failed the conspirators were blinded
according to Byzantine rule: emperors on the other hand were often
unmade; but the political machinery remained the same. In the period to
Heraclius, the ruling class at Constantinople were mainly of Roman
stock; under the Iconoclastic emperors, who were Asiatics, it was
mainly Asiatic; later it became substantially Greek, as each party
drove out the other; but all alike maintained the old imperial ideals.
&ldquo;Men of every rank,&rdquo; says the historian Finlay, &ldquo;were
confined within a restricted circle, and compelled to act in one
unvarying manner. Within the imperial palace the incessant ceremonial
was regarded as the highest branch of human knowledge.... Among the
people at large, though the curial system of castes had been broken
down, still the trader was fettered to his corporation, and often to
his quarter or street ... amidst men of the same profession.... No
learning, no talent, and no virtue could conduct either to distinction
or wealth, unless exercised according to the fixed formulas that
governed the State and the Church. Hence even the merchant, who
travelled over all Asia, and who supported the system by the immense
duties that he furnished to the government, supplied no new ideas to
society, and perhaps passed through life without acquiring
any.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Yet such is the strength of the biological force of
variation that even in religion there was chronic heresy. We have seen,
in tracing the history of western belief in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, how a strenuous anti-clerical heresy, the Paulician, had
arisen and thriven in the East, defying the bloodiest persecution, and
developing in the old fashion into a force of hostility to the empire.
After that heresy had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href=
"#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>thus fatally expelled, others
arose. In the twelfth century, under the theological emperor Manuel
Comnenus, there was a return to the inexhaustible problem of the
incarnation: men disputed as to how God could at the same time be a
sacrifice and the offerer thereof; and the emperor himself, convicted
of heresy, came round to the orthodox view, whatever it was. Soon the
dispute took a new form, over the awkward text &ldquo;My Father is
greater than I&rdquo;; and the emperor gave an orthodox decision which
he engraved on tables of stone for the great Church, denouncing death
on all who taught otherwise. As usual, the dispute was not settled, and
the later emperor Andronicus was fain to take down the tablets and
forbid all discussion on the subject. All the while anti-clerical and
anti-ceremonial heresy persisted; and the burning alive of the monk
Basil, founder of the Gnostic Bogomiles, did not mend matters. The
brutal sack and pillage of Constantinople by the Latin crusaders, and
the generation of western tyranny that followed, did much to unify the
Greek people of the thirteenth century in a common hatred of their
masters, whom they at length cast out; but this, again, meant no new
intellectual life. To the last there was a sufficiency of static Greek
scholarship to preserve much of the ancient heritage for the time when
the Turks should scatter it through the West; but no Byzantine name
belongs to the roll of light-givers in the age of the Renaissance.</p>
<p class="par">If we search for the bearing of religion on the popular
life during the thousand years of the eastern empire, the conclusion
will remain very much the same as that reached by a study of the
conditions of the first centuries of established Christianity.
Boundless credulity, boundless superstition, and zealous idolatry are
the standing features from the seventh century onwards. Conduct was
substantially what it had been in pagan times; and whatever might be
the legal status of those born in slavery, the myriads of captives
enslaved in every successful war can have had no better lot than those
of the ancient world. Doubtless the lot of the Byzantine people in the
mass was better than that of the westerns of the Dark Ages insofar as
they were artisans living <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href=
"#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>under a regular government; but in
the rural districts and outlying regions they can have fared no better,
either in peace or war. When the Saracens wrested Crete and Sicily from
Byzantium early in the ninth century, the majority of the inhabitants
seem to have been little loth to turn Moslems. &ldquo;In almost every
case in which the Saracens conquered Christian nations,&rdquo; says the
Christian historian already quoted, &ldquo;history unfortunately
reveals that they owed their success chiefly to the favour with which
their progress was regarded by the mass of the people. To the disgrace
of most Christian governments, it will be found that their
administration was more oppressive than that of the Arabian
conquerors.&rdquo; We have already seen that both the Arabs and the
Mongols, as apart from the Turks, were by far the more tolerant. When
the Byzantine empire recovered Crete in the tenth century, its rulers
planned to exterminate the Saracen population; and though the purpose
was not carried out, the Saracens who remained were reduced to virtual
serfdom.</p>
<p class="par">Of the moral and intellectual unprogressiveness of
Byzantium we may say, finally, that the Christian State, like those of
the Saracens and the Turks, was in large measure kept stationary
precisely by the relation of constant strife set up by the existence of
the enemy. Each was the curse of its antagonist. And Christianity did
no more to raise men above that deadlock of enmity than did Islam; nay,
the further factor of Byzantine isolation represented by the rupture
between the Greek and Latin Churches was a special product of the
Christian system. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As early as the eleventh century we have seen at
work in both eastern and western Europe movements of popular resistance
at once to the religious claims and the financial methods of the
Christian priesthood, to the dogmas on which those claims and methods
proceeded, and to the ceremonialism which backed them. Early in the
thirteenth century the region in which such heresy had most largely
spread was systematically warred upon by armies called out by the
Church, and there the movement was destroyed by many years of
bloodshed, the once heretical territory becoming a centre of orthodox
fanaticism. The scattered seeds, however, bore fresh fruit, and in the
fourteenth century movements of thought, some of which were no less
deeply heretical, and many no less anti-hierarchical, went far in the
west and north of Europe. Still they failed to effect any revolution;
and in the middle of the fifteenth century the Church of Rome, corrupt
as its rulers were, might have seemed to calculating observers more
surely established than ever before. It had passed through a long and
scandalous series of papal schisms, and its power seemed strengthened
by reunion after a century and a half of divisions.</p>
<p class="par">Heretical forces of course there were, several of the
leading sects of the fourteenth century being still active, especially
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>Germany and the Low Countries. Thus the Brethren
and Sisters of the Free Spirit, who leant to pantheism in doctrine and
to some degree of antinomianism in practice, persisted in spite of
persecution, as did the kindred movements of Beghards or Turlupins;
members of these and similar sects even found shelter in the lower
orders of the Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustinians; and in Italy
and France the heretical Franciscan Fraticelli still obstinately fought
the papacy, which followed them up with fire and sword. But there are
no signs that the papacy had thus far been shaken; and more than one
anti-clerical movement had died out. Thus in England Lollardry had
virtually disappeared in the reign of Henry VI; and in Bohemia, where
the Wiclifian John Huss in the opening years of the century had
preached vehemently against clerical and papal abuses, not only had he
been burned alive on the sentence of the Council of Constance (1415),
in iniquitous disregard of the emperor&rsquo;s letter of safe-conduct,
but his followers, after long and savage wars in which great numbers
were burned alive and they themselves broke up into two sections, had
finally been either reconciled to the Church or reduced to peaceful
nonconformity.</p>
<p class="par">Nowhere could the anti-papal spirit be said to be
dangerously strong; nor was it much regarded by the popes. A little
earlier than Huss, Matthew of Cracow, Bishop of Worms, had written
&ldquo;On the Pollutions (<i>de squaloribus</i>) of the Roman
Curia,&rdquo; but he was never molested. It does not seem, further,
that the cause of the cruel sentence on Huss was so much his attacks on
the clergy or the papacy as the enmities he had aroused (1) in what
passed for philosophy (he being a zealous &ldquo;Realist,&rdquo; and as
such hated by the &ldquo;Nominalists,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3507src" href="#xd21e3507" name="xd21e3507src">1</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>who
were strong in the Council) and (2) on the side of nationality, he
being a Czech nationalist and a vehement enemy of the German race and
interest, which also were present in force. And though the cruelty and
the gross treachery of the sentence on Huss, and the infliction of the
same cruel death on Jerome of Prague in the following year, roused a
furious revolt among the Hussites, these outrages awoke no general
sympathy in Europe.</p>
<p class="par">As the fifteenth century wore on, fresh movements of
anti-papal feeling rose, and some were put down. A professor of
theology at the university of Erfurt, John of Wesel (not to be
confounded with John Wessel, also a critical reformer in theology, but
never persecuted), began about the middle of the century to write
against indulgences; and when he became a popular preacher at Mayence
and Worms he carried his criticism further. The result was that in 1479
he was arraigned before a &ldquo;court of Inquisition&rdquo; at Mayence
and cast into prison, where he soon died. Wesel was a Nominalist, and
as such was no less hated by the Realists than Huss had been by the
Nominalists; but since he was also denounced as a Hussite, and was
further an extremely free-tongued assailant of the hierarchy, there is
reason in his case to suppose a professional animus. Still there was no
formidable movement. Before John of Wesel, the Netherlander John of
Goch, Confessor to the Nuns of Tabor (d. 1475), had opposed both
monasticism and episcopal power; but he was associated with the
orthodox Brethren of the Common Lot, and had criticized the antinomian
morals of the Brethren of the Free Spirit, so that he hardly figured as
a heretic. John Wessel, again (d. 1489), anticipated, as Luther
declared, most of the latter&rsquo;s doctrines; but though he wandered
in France and Italy, studied and taught at Paris, and was a professor
at Heidelberg, exercising a wide influence, he never roused enmity
enough to bring him into trouble. On the other hand, Savonarola&rsquo;s
strong dissentient movement at Florence, as we have already noted, fell
with him in 1498.</p>
<p class="par">All the while, nevertheless, there was proceeding an
intellectual process which had not before been possible&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>permeation of the northern part of the
continent, especially Germany, by a spirit of comparatively orthodox
anti-Romanism, based on a growing scholarship, which found in the
sacred books themselves a basis for its course. The scholarly impulse
had come from Italy, where it had been fostered by the papacy itself;
but in the north it had a different social and political effect. In
Germany and the Netherlands, to begin with, elementary education was
gaining ground. The Brethren of the Common Lot had done much for it,
and many of their pupils started fresh schools, which weakened the
first, but carried further their work. At the same time sprang up new
universities; those of T&uuml;bingen, Mayence, Wittemberg, and
Frankfort-on-the-Oder being founded between 1477 and 1506. In the
higher Biblical scholarship, further, there had begun a new era.
Laurentius Valla&rsquo;s <i>Notes on the New Testament</i> created a
spirit of scholarlike criticism; and John Reuchlin, after a training in
France, began in Germany an equally vigorous movement of Hebrew
scholarship by producing the first Hebrew grammar. Numbers of educated
men were now in a position of intellectual superiority to the great
mass of the clergy; and all the while the process of translating the
New Testament or the gospels into the modern languages for the use of
the unlearned was going on in all the more civilized countries. There
were German translations before Luther; Wiclif&rsquo;s versions had
been current in England among the Lollards; and French and Italian
versions had been made by several hands in the fifteenth century. The
important result was that anti-clerical heresy began to claim to be the
stricter orthodoxy, and the Church could no longer bracket the sin of
anti-clericalism with that of rejecting the leading Christian dogmas.
Thus, when Erasmus of Rotterdam began with a new and remarkable
literary skill to write Latin satires on the old text of the vices and
ignorance of the monks and other clergy, he had such an audience as no
man had yet had on that theme. In Petrarch&rsquo;s day, a century
before, though he too had exclaimed like every other educated layman at
the corruption of the papal court and system, humanist literature was
still largely a matter of exquisite art for art&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>sake; in that of Erasmus it had begun to handle
the most vital intellectual and moral interests.</p>
<p class="par">Yet, though such an intellectual ferment was a condition
precedent of the Reformation, it was not the proximate cause of the
explosion. The doctrinal movement is seen at its strongest after
Luther&rsquo;s disruptive work had been done, in the allied movement
set up in France by Calvinism. More perhaps than in Geneva itself, the
Huguenot cause in France was one of moral and intellectual revolt,
certainly fanatical but in large measure disinterested. What
precipitated the Reformation in Germany was the coalition of the
decisive economic interest of the self-seeking nobles, and the
anti-Roman national sentiment of the people, with the moral and
doctrinal appeal of Luther.</p>

Economic Forces</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Even the grievance of indulgence-selling, which
gave the immediate impulse to Luther&rsquo;s action, was an economic as
well as a moral question. Many of the best Catholics were entirely at
one with him and such of his predecessors as Wesel and Wessel in
deploring and denouncing the form the traffic had taken. The process of
farming out the sale of indulgences to districts, as governments farmed
out the taxes, was enough to stagger all men capable of independent
judgment; and the expedition of the Dominican monk Tetzel had reduced
it to something like burlesque. Yet it was typical of what papal
administration had become. Archbishop Albert of Mayence and Magdeburg,
who was also margrave of Brandenburg, owed the pope the usual large sum
for his investiture, and could not pay. The pope, Leo X, greatly needed
money for his building outlays; and the supreme prince of the Church
gave to the lesser permission to set up in his province a vigorous
trade in indulgences. For this trade Tetzel was selected, not by the
pope but by the archbishop, as a notoriously suitable tool. Albert in
turn made a financial arrangement with the great German banking house
of Fuggers, and their agent accompanied Tetzel to take care of the
cash. Thus, though the transaction was strictly a German one, the
procedure was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>externally one of bleeding a German province,
through its superstition, in the financial interest of Rome.
Well-informed people knew that the papal agent carried off at least the
archbishop&rsquo;s debt; and others might plausibly surmise that there
had gone a million thalers more, as the takings had been abnormally
great.</p>
<p class="par">Obviously the mass of the citizens were superstitious
believers, otherwise the traffic could not have gone on; and Luther in
his pulpit began merely by opposing the abuse of the practice, not the
canonical principle. In absolution, he correctly argued, there were
according to the established doctrine three elements&mdash;contrition,
confession, and remission of penalties; and indulgences could effect
only the third. He accordingly refused to absolve any on the mere
ground of an indulgence; whereupon Tetzel, finding his traffic thus
ostensibly hampered, preached against him, and the historic battle
began. The theses nailed to the Wittemberg church door by Luther (1517)
did not assail the Church or the pope; they simply challenged on
orthodox lines the abuse of indulgences; and when Luther began to
publish his views he expressed himself with perfect submission to the
pope.</p>
<p class="par">What won him the support of a vigorous popular party,
albeit a minority, and of a sufficient section of the nobility, was in
the first place his courage, and in the second place the growing
restiveness of the Germans as such under what was practically an
Italian domination. In past history, the &ldquo;Germanic empire&rdquo;
had been wont to lord it over Italy on feudal grounds, and it was
always a sore point with many that Italy none the less received an
increasing tribute from Germany as from other States. The blunder of
the papacy in Luther&rsquo;s case lay in not realizing how far such
feelings, in connection with a fresh scandal, might go in setting up a
northern tide of anti-Roman animus. So long wont to brow-beat all
insubordination, and to decide doctrinal disputes by fiat instead of by
persuasion, it either prescribed or permitted to its agents the usual
tone in their dealings with Luther; and finally the pope thought to
clinch matters by a bull (1520) against his doctrines, giving him his
choice between submission <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href=
"#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>and excommunication. His defiance,
and the act of excommunication, duly followed, and the Protestant
Church began.</p>
<p class="par">Even now the papacy, witless of new developments, could
very well suppose the new heresy transient. Charles V, the new Emperor,
was thoroughly orthodox; and not many of the German nobles were
ostensibly otherwise. But Charles was under a deep obligation to
Frederick the Elector of Saxony for his election; and Frederick was one
of those who had begun, for racial and financial reasons, to
contemplate &ldquo;home rule&rdquo; in matters ecclesiastical.
Frederick accordingly was allowed to protect Luther, whose courage in
going to the Diet of Worms, with Huss&rsquo;s fate in common memory,
further established his popular influence. Manhood always loves
manhood. After 1526, however, the process of the Reformation in Germany
was substantially one of wholesale confiscation of Church lands and
goods by the nobles, who were thus irrevocably committed to the cause;
and though Luther and his more single-minded colleagues were naturally
disgusted, there was no other way in which they could have won, popular
sympathy counting for nothing in such a matter without military
force.</p>
<p class="par">A rupture took place, finally, between the Emperor and
the new Medicean pope, Clement VII, over the desperate politics of
Italy, the papacy for once taking a national course in resisting an
imperialist invasion. But the invaders triumphed; Italy was overrun
anew; Rome was sacked (1527) with all the atrocity which historically
distinguishes the Christian conquests of the city from those of the
ancient Gauls and Goths; and during the critical years of the
establishment of Protestantism the emperor was in no mood to quarrel
with his German friends in the interests of a pope whose friendship he
could not trust. All the political conditions were thus abnormally
favourable to the Lutheran movement. At the same time, every menace
from Rome led naturally to intensification of the Lutheran heresy; and
though it always remained nearer Catholicism <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e3558" title="Corrected by author from: that">than</span> did
Calvinism, it emphasized more and more its differences.</p>
<p class="par">In the meantime the success of the movement of Zwingli
at Zurich had proved independently that the strength of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>Reformation lay in its appeal to economic
interest. Confiscation of the possessions of the Church by the
municipal authorities was a first step, and one for which, once taken,
the community would fight rather than revoke it. With signal unwisdom,
the Roman curia had contrived to allot most of the Swiss town livings
to Italians, so that the vested interests were alien and not local. The
municipality, on the other hand, sagaciously pacified those interests
by guaranteeing pensions or posts as teachers or preachers to the whole
twenty-four <span class="corr" id="xd21e3565" title=
"Source: canons">cantons</span> of the chapter; and there and in some
other cantons the economic Reformation, thus effected, was
permanent.</p>
<p class="par">In the case of England, on the other hand, the primary
factor in the repudiation of papal rule was the personal insistence of
Henry VIII on a divorce from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, the
aunt of the emperor, Charles V. Henry was so far from being inclined to
Protestantism that he caused to be compiled by his bishops (1521) a
treatise in reply to Luther, to which he put his name, thereupon
receiving from Leo X the title of &ldquo;Defender of the Faith.&rdquo;
To the very last, he burned doctrinal Protestants as heretics, and
despite revival of the old Lollard propaganda the country remained
substantially Catholic in creed. But when it came to the king&rsquo;s
demand for a divorce, the new pope, Clement VII, was in a hopeless
dilemma, since if he granted the request, which he was personally and
theologically not unwilling to do, he would exasperate the emperor
Charles, of whom he dreaded to make an irreconcilable enemy, besides
offending the whole Catholicism of Spain and even much of that of
England. When once Henry decided to take ecclesiastical rule into his
own hands he found that, little as he liked the new doctrines, he must
in his own interest proceed to confiscate Church lands and bestow the
bulk of them on adherents, thereby establishing a firm anti-papal
interest. So little way did positive Protestant doctrine make that when
his daughter Mary came to the throne, though she dared not try to
resume the Church lands, the people were in substantial sympathy with
her faith, and only her marriage with Philip and her persecution of
heretics turned any large number <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253"
href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>against her. Even under
Elizabeth it was the new national enmity to Spain, and not religious
propaganda, that made the bulk of the people Protestant in creed and
worship.</p>
<p class="par">The process of the Reformation in Scotland clearly
follows the economic law. So late as 1535 Scotland was so Catholic in
belief, despite the usual grievances against priestly rapacity and
luxury, that the parliament passed a law forbidding all importation of
the writings of Luther, and all discussion of his &ldquo;damnable
opinions.&rdquo; But as soon as the English king by his confiscation of
the rich monastery lands (1536&ndash;39) showed the Scots nobles how
they might enrich themselves by turning Protestant, they began to
favour heresy; and from the death (1542) of the last Catholic king,
James V, throughout the minority of his daughter Mary, they protected
the reforming preachers. In 1543 began the wrecking of monasteries by
mobs; in 1546 was assassinated Cardinal Beaton, who had taken active
steps to destroy heresy; and though the ferocious war with England
delayed developments, as did the regency of the Queen&rsquo;s French
mother, the preaching of Calvinism by John Knox and others carried
enough of the townspeople to make easy the passing, in 1560, of an Act
which made Protestantism the established religion of the country. As
usual, by far the greater part of the plunder went to the landowning
class, who brazenly broke all their promises of endowment to the
preachers. But the latter had perforce to submit, indignant as they
were; and when the young Catholic queen Mary arrived in 1561 she found
a Protestant kingdom, in which the most powerful class was rich with
church spoils. Again the political and the economic forces had been the
obviously determining factors in the change.</p>
<p class="par">Scandinavian Protestantism, in turn, moved on the same
line of economic opportunity and pressure. A popular movement seems to
have begun in Denmark, but it was favoured by the throne; and the
nobles, seeing the possibilities of the case, soon followed; whereupon
King Christian III, who ruled both Denmark and Norway, suppressed
Catholicism with the nobles&rsquo; help, and confiscated the rich
possessions of the bishops. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href=
"#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>In Sweden, on the other hand,
Gustavus Vasa took the initiative against the clergy, who had supported
the Danish rule which he succeeded in throwing off; and he naturally
had with him the mass of the laity, especially when he gave the nobles
leave to reclaim the lands that had been granted by their ancestors to
the monasteries. Doctrinal Protestantism followed in the wake of
confiscation.</p>
<p class="par">The Protestantism of Holland, again, was plainly the
result of the mismanagement of Philip II. When Protestantism had in
other countries reached its fullest extension the Low Countries were
still mainly Catholic, only a few of the poorer classes having changed,
apart from the Anabaptist movement, which had a much larger following;
and the slaughter of such heretics by the Inquisition went on for many
years with the acquiescence of the middle and upper orders. In the
Netherlands the local Inquisition, conducted by natives, was positively
more cruel than that of Spain. It is thus clear that there was no
special bias to Protestantism in the &ldquo;Teutonic&rdquo; races as
such. The orthodox Protestant movement entered Holland not from the
German but from the French side; and it needed not only the ferocity
but the rapacity of Alva to create a permanent Protestant and
rationalist movement among the needy nobility. When the Protestant mobs
began to resort to image-breaking they put their cause in great peril.
The real reason of the slowness of the nobles to turn Protestant was,
doubtless, that they had little to gain from plunder of their Church in
any case, it having long been abnormally poor by reason of the
restrictive policy of the Flemish and Dutch feudal princes in the past.
When the rupture with Spain was complete the Church estates were
scrupulously disposed of in the public interest, Dutch Protestantism
being thus exceptionally clean-handed.</p>
<p class="par">Philip&rsquo;s attempts to enrich the priesthood were
certainly part of the provocation he gave his subjects in the
Netherlands; but their resentment was at the outset strictly political,
not religious; and it is reasonable to say that had he chosen to reside
among them and conciliate them he could easily have kept them Catholic,
while in that case Spain might very <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>well have become
Protestant, and Dutch and Flemish resources would have been turned
against Spanish disaffection. Even in what remained the Spanish
Netherlands Catholicism entirely recovered its ground. The Teutonic
Charles V had been as rigidly Catholic as his predecessors on the
Spanish throne, and for the same reasons, (1) that the Church in his
dominions helped him and did not thwart him; and (2) that his large
revenues from the Netherlands made it unnecessary for him to plunder
the Church as did the Scandinavian kings and Henry VIII.</p>
<p class="par">In the case of France, where Protestantism reached its
highest development in point of intellectual and militant energy, but
became stationary after a generation of desperate strife, and later
decayed, the play of political and economic causation is little less
clear. There, as has been said, there was much less ostensible pressure
of wealth-seeking interest on the side of the Reformation than in
Germany and elsewhere; yet so far as the nobles were concerned an
economic motive was certainly at work. At the outset of his reign
Francis I had won from the pope, practically at the sword&rsquo;s
point, the concession (1516) of the right to appoint bishops and
abbots, the papacy in return receiving the <i>annates</i>, or first
year&rsquo;s revenue. The result was that the Gallican Church was at
least as corrupt as any other section of the fold, its dignities being
usually bestowed on court favourites, whose exactions exasperated the
rural gentry as much as those of papal nominees would have done. The
throne being strong, however, and the king having no special financial
motive to go further, the cause of reform had no help from his side.
Had he turned &ldquo;reformer,&rdquo; as he once had some thought of
doing, he could probably have made France Protestant with less
difficulty than Henry VIII met with in England; but in view of the
political divisions set up by Lutheranism in Germany he decided against
the new propaganda.</p>
<p class="par">That, nevertheless, proceeded. There had always been
keen criticism of the Church in France; and as early as 1512 there
began at Meaux a reform movement on substantially Protestant lines,
under the auspices of the local bishop. He, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>however, was put down by the threats of the
college of the Sorbonne, the ecclesiastical faculty of the university
of Paris; and the first notable signs of anti-Romanism came from the
Vaudois of Provence, a small population who had been settled there
after the virtual extermination of their predecessors of the same name
and stock in the thirteenth century, and who were latterly found to
have the same anti-clerical tendencies. Under Louis XII the Church had
sought to punish them, but he refused to permit it, declaring them
better people than the orthodox. Finding themselves in sympathy with
the Reform movement, they sent some of their own preachers to
Switzerland and Germany (1530) to learn from it, and began a similar
propaganda. Decrees were issued against them in 1535 and 1540, but
Francis proposed to spare them on condition that they should enter the
Church of Rome. This policy failing, and Francis having made a treaty
with Charles V, under which, on papal pressure, he agreed to put down
heresy, the Vaudois were given up to coercion. There ensued a massacre
so vile (1545) that the king, now near his end, was revolted by it,
declaring that his orders had been grossly exceeded. A slow process of
inquiry, left to his son, dragged on for years, but finally came to
nothing.</p>
<p class="par">The Vaudois had been nearly exterminated, in the old
fashion; but the massacre served to proclaim and spread their doctrine,
which rapidly gained ground among the skilled artisan class as well as
among the nobles, the Swiss printing-presses doing it signal service.
Persecution, as usual, kept pace with propaganda; and in 1557 Pope Paul
IV, with the king&rsquo;s approval, decreed that the Inquisition should
be set up in France, where it had never yet been established. The legal
&ldquo;parliament&rdquo; of Paris, jealous for its privileges,
successfully resisted; but the Sorbonne and the Church carried on the
work of heretic-burning, till at length the Huguenots were driven to
arms (1562). Their name had probably come from that of the
German-speaking <i lang="de">Eidgenossen</i>
(&ldquo;oath-fellows&rdquo;) of Switzerland; but their doctrine was
that of Calvin, who, driven from France (1533), was now long
established at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>Geneva; and their tenacity showed the value of
his close-knit dogmatism as a political inspiration. Catholic
fanaticism and treachery on the one hand, and Huguenot intemperance on
the other, brought about eight furious civil wars in the period
1562&ndash;94. The high-water mark of wickedness in that generation was
the abominable Massacre of St. Bartholomew (1572), which followed on
the third truce, and roused a new intensity of hatred. So evenly
balanced were the forces that only after more than twenty years of
further convulsions was the strife ended by the politic decision of the
Protestant Henry of Navarre to turn Catholic and so win the crown
(1594), on the score that &ldquo;Paris was well worth a Mass.&rdquo; He
thus secured for his Protestant supporters a perfect toleration, which
he confirmed by the Edict of Nantes (1597).</p>
<p class="par">In Poland and Bohemia, where also Protestantism went
far, on bases laid by the old movements of the Hussites, the process
was at first facilitated, as in Germany, by the political conditions;
and the economic motive was clearly potent. The subsequent collapse and
excision of Protestantism in those countries, as in France, in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, completes the proof that for the
modern as for the ancient world political and economic forces are the
determinants of a creed&rsquo;s success or failure, culture movements
being, as it were, the force of variation which they condition.</p>

Political Results</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the side of daily life, it fared with
Protestantism as with the early Church: where it was warred upon it was
socially circumspect; where it had easier course it was lax. Thus we
have the express admissions of Luther and of Calvin that under
Protestantism they found less spirituality around them than there had
been under Romanism; and there is abundant evidence that the first
effect of the new regimen in Germany was to promote what Catholic and
Protestant teachers alike professed to think the most serious form of
immorality&mdash;sexual licence. In point of fact, Luther&rsquo;s own
doctrines of predestination and grace were a species of unbought
indulgences, sure to injure good morals, even apart <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>from
the effect of a free use of the Bible as a working code. Some of
Luther&rsquo;s fellow-preachers justified and practised bigamy; and he
and his colleagues not only counselled Henry VIII to marry a second
time without divorcing his first queen, but gave their official
consent, albeit reluctantly, to such a proceeding on the part of the
Landgrave of Hesse. Among the common people, the new sense of freedom
quickly gave a religious impulse to the lamentable Peasants&rsquo; War,
and later to the so-called Anabaptist movement, which, though it
contained elements of sincerity and virtue that are not always
acknowledged, amounted in the main to a movement of moral and social
chaos.</p>
<p class="par">Luther, during whose time of hiding in the Wartburg
(1521&ndash;22) the new ferment began at Wittemberg, came thither to
denounce it as a work of Satan; but it was a sequel of his own action.
The new leaders, Storch and M&uuml;nzer and Carlstadt, had turned as he
had advised to the Bible, and there they found texts for whatever they
were minded to try, from image-smashing to the plunder and burning of
monasteries and castles, and a general effort at social revolution. In
all they did, they declared and believed they were moved by the Spirit
of God. Luther had done this service to Catholicism, that his course
led to the practical proof that the Bible, put in the hands of the
multitude as the sufficient guide to conduct, wrought far more harm
than good. Peasant revolts, indeed, had repeatedly occurred in Germany
before his time, the gross tyranny of the nobles provoking them; but
the religious frenzy of M&uuml;nzer gave to the rising of 1524&ndash;25
in Swabia and Franconia, though the formulated demands of the
insurgents were just and reasonable, a character of wildness and
violence seldom seen before. Luther, accordingly, to save his own
position, vehemently denounced the rising, and hounded on the nobles to
its bloody suppression, a work in which they needed no urging. His
protector, the wise Frederick of Saxony, then on his deathbed, gave no
such evil counsel, but advised moderation, and admitted the guilt of
his order towards the common people. The end was, however, that at
least 100,000 peasants were slain; and the lot of those left was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>worse than before. The later Anabaptist
movement, which set up a short-lived republic (1535) in the city of
M&uuml;nster in Westphalia, and spread to Holland, was too destitute of
political sanity to gain any but visionaries, and was everywhere put
down with immense bloodshed.</p>
<p class="par">Yet vaster social and political evils were to come from
the Reformation. In 1526, at the Diet of Spires, the emperor Charles V
called for strong measures against Lutheranism, but was firmly resisted
by the new Elector of Saxony and the other Lutheran princes, whereupon
the emperor waived his claim, not caring to raise a war in the
pope&rsquo;s interest; and it was agreed that each head of a State in
the empire should take his own way in regard to religion, his subjects
being at his disposal. It was at this stage that the German Reformation
began its most decisive progress. In the next few years the papal
party, backed by the Emperor, twice carried decrees rescinding that of
1526. First came the decree of the second Diet of Spires (1529).
Against this a formal protest was made to the emperor by the Lutheran
princes and a number of the free imperial cities of Germany and
Switzerland, whence arose first the title of &ldquo;Protestants.&rdquo;
In 1530 the emperor convened a fresh Diet at Augsburg, to which the
Lutherans were required to bring a formal Confession of Faith. This was
framed on conciliatory lines; but the emperor issued a fresh coercive
decree, whereupon the Germans formed the defensive League of Smalkald,
from which the Swiss were excluded on their refusal to sign the
Augsburg Confession. At this stage the invasion of Austria by the Turks
delayed civil war, so that Luther was able to die in peace (1546). Then
war began, and the Protestant League was quickly and thoroughly
overthrown by the emperor. After a few years, however, the imperial
tyranny, exercised through Spanish troops, forced a revolt of the
Protestant princes, who with the help of France defeated Charles
(1552). Now was effected the Peace of Augsburg (signed 1555), which
left the princes as before to determine at their own will whether their
States should be Lutheran or Catholic, and entitled them to keep what
Church lands they had confiscated before 1552. No <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>protection whatever was decreed for Calvinists,
with whom the Lutherans had long been at daggers drawn, and who had not
yet gained much ground in Germany.</p>
<p class="par">Such a peace failed to settle the vital question as to
whether in future the Protestant princes could make further
confiscations, on the plea of the conversion of Catholic bishops and
abbots or otherwise. As the century wore on, accordingly, the princes
&ldquo;secularized&rdquo; many more Church estates; and as
Protestantism was all the while losing moral ground in Germany through
the adoption of Calvinism by several princes, and the bitter quarrels
of the sects and sub-sects, the Catholics held the more strongly to
their view of the Augsburg treaty, which was that all bishoprics and
abbeys held directly from the emperor were to remain Catholic. Friction
grew from decade to decade, and, civic wisdom making no progress on
either side, a number of the Lutherans and Calvinists at length formed
(1608) a militant union, led by the Calvinist prince Christian of
Anhalt, to defend their gains; and the Catholics, led by Maximilian,
Duke of Bavaria, formed another. The Calvinists were the chief
firebrands; and Christian was bent on aggression, to the end of
upsetting the power of the Catholic House of Austria.</p>
<p class="par">The train, however, was fired from Bohemia, where the
Protestant nobles were at odds with their two successive kings,
Matthias and Ferdinand, both of that house, and both bent on putting
down Protestantism on the crown lands. The nobles began a revolt in a
brutally lawless fashion; and when, in a winter pause of the war,
Ferdinand was elected emperor (1619), they deposed him from the throne
of Bohemia, and elected in his place the Calvinist prince Frederick,
Elector Palatine (son-in-law of James I of England), who foolishly
accepted. The capable Maximilian, with Tilly for general, took the
field on behalf of Ferdinand; the Lutheran princes stood aloof from
Frederick, who for his own part had offended his Lutheran subjects by
slighting their rites; his few allies could not sustain him, and he was
easily defeated and put to headlong flight. At once the leading
Protestant nobles of Bohemia were put to death; their lands were
confiscated; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>the clergy of the chief Protestant body, the
Bohemian Brethren, dating back to the time of Huss, were expelled in
mass; and Protestantism in Bohemia was soon practically at an end. Many
of both the Lutheran and Calvinist churches, in their resentment at the
slackness of the German Protestant League, voluntarily went over to
Catholicism. At the same period the Protestant Prince of Transylvania
had been in alliance with the Turks to attack Vienna; and the
Protestant faith was thus discredited on another side.</p>
<p class="par">Meantime, however, the Thirty Years&rsquo; War had
begun. Frederick&rsquo;s general, Mansfeld, held out for him in the
Palatinate; the dissolution of the army of the Protestant Union
supplied him with fresh soldiers, content to live by plunder; English
volunteers and new German allies joined; and the struggle went from bad
to worse. The failure or defeat of the first Protestant combatants
brought others upon the scene; James of England appealed to Gustavus
Adolphus of Sweden and Christian IV of Denmark to join him in
recovering the Palatinate for his son-in-law, and, unable to subsidize
Gustavus as he required, made terms with Christian, who at once entered
the war. Thereupon the emperor employed Wallenstein, and the
Protestants were defeated and hard pressed, till the great Gustavus
came to their aid. Under his masterly leadership they regained their
ground, but could not decisively triumph. After his death at the battle
of L&uuml;tzen (1632) new developments took place, France entering the
imbroglio by way of weakening her enemies Austria and Spain, the two
pillars of the empire; and one period of war passed into another
without stay or respite.</p>
<p class="par">In the course of this inconceivable struggle children
grew to middle age, and men grew from youth to grey hairs; most of
those who began the strife passed away ere it had ended; the French
Richelieu rose to greatness and died; and the English Civil War passed
through nearly its whole course, a mere episode in comparison. When at
length there was signed the Peace of Westphalia (1648) the German world
was reduced to mortal exhaustion. The armies on both sides had been to
the common people as the monstrous dragons of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>fable, bestial devourers, dealing ruin to friend
and foe alike. Every sack of a city was a new triumph of cruelty and
wickedness; tortures were inflicted by the mercenaries which almost
redeemed the name of the Inquisition; and, as of old in the Ireland of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s day, peasants were found dead with grass in their
mouths. According to some calculations, half of the entire population
of Germany was gone; and it is certain that in many districts numbers
and wealth, man and beast, had been reduced in a much greater
proportion, whole provinces being denuded of live stock, and whole
towns going to ruin. German civilization had been thrown back a full
hundred years, morally and materially. No such procession of brutality
and vice as followed the armies of Tilly and Wallenstein had been seen
since the first Crusade; and the generation which had seen them and
been able to survive them was itself grown callous. Capacity, culture,
and conduct had alike fallen below the levels of a century before.</p>
<p class="par">By the Peace of Westphalia were settled the boundaries
of the two creeds which had thus battled for a whole generation. In
Germany proselytism was at an end; but the States whose princes had
been Protestant remained so, they and their Catholic neighbours keeping
the right to impose their faith on their subjects. Protestantism had
gained nothing beyond rooting Catholicism more completely out of
Protestant States; and, on the other hand, the Catholics had rooted
heresy out of theirs. No racial dividing-line subsisted. Teutonic
Bavaria and Austria remained Catholic, as the five original Teutonic
cantons of Switzerland had done from the first; and between Lutherans
and Calvinists, of whatever stock, there remained a sullen doctrinal
division. Bohemia had been lost to Protestantism, and Poland was now
far on the way to the same fate.</p>
<p class="par">The diverse cases of Poland and France here supply yet
another lesson in economic causation. In France at the accession of
Henry IV the Protestants were a very strong party, including many of
the nobles, though a minority of the nation; in Poland, at the
accession of Sigismund III, in 1586, they were considerably stronger.
Within half-a-century they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href=
"#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>were in full decadence in both
countries, from similar causes. Sigismund (the cousin of Gustavus
Adolphus), though grandson of the Protestant Gustavus Vasa of Sweden,
had been bred a Catholic with a view to his inheriting the Polish
crown; and from the day of his accession he set himself to the
aggrandizement of his creed. He thereby lost the crown of Sweden, but
he went far to make Poland Catholic; and the newly constituted order of
Jesuits did the rest. To the Polish crown belonged the right of
conferring life appointments to which were attached great tracts of
crown land; and the constant use of this economic force for Catholicism
during a long reign began the downfall of the Protestantism of the
nobility, who, though including many men of superior capacity, had been
moved as usual by the economic motive in their heresy. The complete
ascendancy of the Jesuits during the seventeenth century ultimately
wrought the ruin of Poland, their policy having expelled the
Protestants, alienated the Cossacks, who belonged to the Greek Church,
and paralyzed the intellectual life of the nation.</p>
<p class="par">In France the decay of Protestantism was caused
substantially by economic means. When Richelieu obtained power the
Huguenot party was strong, turbulent, intolerant, and aggressive.
Practising on the one hand a firm political control, and on the other a
strict tolerance, he began the policy of detaching the ablest nobles
from the Huguenot interest by giving them positions of the highest
honour and trust, the holding of which soon reconciled them to the
court. Thus deprived of leaders who were men of the world, the Huguenot
party fell into the hands of its fanatical clergy, under whose guidance
it became more aggressive, and so provoked fresh civil war. The balance
of military power being now easily on the side of the crown, the
revolts were decisively put down; and the policy of
anti-ecclesiasticism and toleration, persisted in by Richelieu and
carried on after him by Mazarin, prevented any further strife. Thus
French Protestantism was irretrievably on the decline when Louis XIV,
reverting to the politics of Catholic bigotry, and not content with
setting on foot cruel persecutions which drove many from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>the
country despite the laws against emigration, committed the immense and
criminal blunder of revoking the Edict of Nantes (1685), and so
expelling from France the remnant of the Huguenots. He had been advised
that the refusal of liberty of worship would bring them to the Church,
and that they could be hindered from emigrating. On the contrary, his
plan lost to France fifty thousand families of industrious inhabitants,
whose Protestantism had ceased to be turbulent, though it remained
austere; and by thus grievously weakening a kingdom already heavily
bled by his wars, the French king prepared his own military
humiliation, and the consequent depression of his Church. It must
always be remembered, however, that his course was acclaimed by the
<i>&eacute;lite</i> of Catholic culture.</p>
<p class="par">The alarm and resentment set up by his act counted for
much in stirring the English people three years later to resist their
Romanizing king James II, who, had he gone his way more prudently,
might have done much to rehabilitate Catholicism in virtue of the
fanatical devotion to the throne already developed by the reaction
against the Puritan rebellion. On the other hand, the tyrannous policy
which had kept Ireland Catholic, by identifying Protestantism with
oppression, and Catholicism with the national memories, was cruelly
carried on by England, with the result of maintaining a perpetual
division between the two countries, and preparing a great source of
Catholic population for the United States in a later age. The profound
decivilization inflicted on Ireland by Protestant England is probably
the greatest of the social and political evils resulting from the
Reformation; but the persecution of dissenters in England, and the more
savage dragooning of Presbyterians in Scotland under Charles II and
James II (which had an excuse in the aggressive intolerance of the
Covenanters) must go to the same account. Nowhere, not even in
Protestant Switzerland&mdash;save in the case of Zurich, well led by
Zwingli, and in that of the Grisons, where Catholics and Protestants
agreed to abolish feudal abuses&mdash;did the Reformation work social
betterment for the common people. In England the tyranny of the
Protestant nobles under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href=
"#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>Edward VI was both corrupt and
cruel; and the Norfolk rising of 1549 was as savagely suppressed as
that of Wat Tyler had been in Catholic times.</p>
<p class="par">In the processes by which Protestantism lost ground, as
in those by which Catholicism counteracted its own successes, there was
a considerable play of intellectual forces, which we shall consider
apart. But though the economic, the political, and the intellectual
forces always interact, the two former have had a potency which has
thus far been little acknowledged. It is essential to realize that they
have affected the movement of thought more than they have been affected
by it; and above all that they, and not the imaginary bias of race,
have determined the total fortunes of the Reformation.</p>

Results</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The intellectual reactions set up by the
Reformation were complex, and on some sides apparently contradictory.
Some populations, and in general the populace of the countries which
remained Protestant, were made collectively more fanatical than they
had been under Catholicism, even as Catholicism itself became for a
time more strenuous under the stress of the conflict; but, on the other
hand, there grew up on the intellectual border of Protestantism forms
of heresy which outraged its majority; and within the political sphere
of Catholicism there came a new growth of skepticism. All these varying
results can be traced to the initial shock of the revolt against
Rome.</p>
<p class="par">Luther and Calvin, it is clear, were alike bigots, as
little disposed to religious toleration as the papacy ever was. Of pope
Paul III (1534&ndash;49) it is recorded that he &ldquo;bore with
contradiction in the consistory, and encouraged freedom of
discussion.&rdquo; No such tribute could be paid to the Protestant
leaders of his day. Indeed, it is noteworthy that while the Catholic
hierarchy of the period were not a little open to new scientific
thought, Luther derided the teaching of Copernicus, and would have
suppressed it if he could. It resulted from the spirit of such leaders
that their polities could not be reconciled. Luther, though he
proceeded from a theoretical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>retention of the Mass (set forth
in the conciliatory Augsburg Confession of 1530, drawn up by
Melanchthon) to a bitter denunciation of it, always leant towards the
Catholic doctrine of the eucharist in that he merely substituted the
dogma of &ldquo;consubstantiation&rdquo; for
&ldquo;transubstantiation,&rdquo; and refused to go further. The Swiss
Protestants took up another position. Their chief founder, Ulrich
Zwingli, a more rational spirit than Luther, and brave enough to teach
that good heathens might be saved, went boldly back to the position of
John Scotus, and taught that the bread and wine of the sacrament were
merely memorial symbols. On this head, despite the efforts of
Melanchthon, Luther refused all compromise, and denounced the
Zwinglians with his usual violence. Calvin, whose power in Geneva was
established in 1541, tempered their formula after Luther&rsquo;s death
to the extent of affirming, in Lutheran language, that in the eucharist
a certain divine influence was communicated to faithful participants.
But even this could not secure the dogmatic agreement that the
theological ideal demanded; and the followers of Luther soon gave the
quarrel a quality of incurable bitterness. Even on the question of
predestination the sects could not agree, though both Luther and
Calvin, in their different terminologies, affirmed the foreordination
of all things.</p>
<p class="par">These were only the most comprehensive of a multitude of
Protestant divisions. In the sixteenth century there are enumerated by
ecclesiastical historians at least eighty Protestant sects, all named
for certain special tenets, or after leaders who held themselves apart.
The general resort to the Bible had thus revived the phenomena of the
early ages of the faith; and each leading sect or church within its own
sphere sought in the papal fashion to suppress variation. The result
was a maximum of dogmatism and malice. Every sect split into many. Thus
there were some thirteen groups of Anabaptists; over thirty separate
confessions were drawn up among the main bodies; and Luther enumerated
nine varieties of doctrine on the eucharist alone. The doctrine
seldomest broached was that of mutual toleration. Between Lutherans and
Calvinists the quarrel went so far that when John Laski, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>the
learned Polish Calvinist, was sailing from England to the continent on
his expulsion with his adherents from England under Mary, he was
refused leave to remain at the Lutheran ports of Elsinore, Hamburg,
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3671" title=
"Source: Lubeck">L&uuml;beck</span>, and Rostock. But as time went on
the Lutherans were divided endlessly and irreconcilably on doctrinal
issues among themselves. Melanchthon died declaring the gladness with
which he passed away from a world filled with the rabid hatreds of
theologians; and after his day matters grew worse instead of
better.</p>
<p class="par">From the very first, in short, the temper of Protestant
propaganda, met as it was by brutal resistance, had been one of brutal
animosity. There is indeed no more grotesque spectacle in human history
than the association of the phrase &ldquo;a religion of love&rdquo;
with the masses of furious controversy which constitute the bulk of
Christian theological literature in all ages of faith. Amenity has been
much rarer in religious strife than in actual warfare, where animal
good humour could at times mitigate or overlay animal hate. Fighters
could meet and banquet after a fight: theologians could not. They could
feel kindly towards those only who joined them in hating the foe.
England, with her Pecock and her Hooker, makes as good a show in this
matter as any other country; but in England the temper of the struggle
between Protestantism and Catholicism is from the first one of intense
hate, the cultured Catholic Sir Thomas More showing as little capacity
for gentleness of spirit as do the violent assailants who exasperated
him. Bale, a typical Protestant polemist, seems habitually to foam at
the mouth. War was the natural and inevitable expression of such
hatreds wherever it could come about; and when the establishment of
Protestantism left the sectarian spirit free play as between sects,
they turned to the new debate all the ferocity that had marked the
old.</p>
<p class="par">It was thus abundantly proved that the cult of the Bible
gave no help towards peace and goodwill; and Catholicism naturally
profited by the demonstration, many peaceable Protestants returning to
its fold. In Germany such reversions were set up alike by the attitude
of Luther towards the revolting peasants, many of whom in turn rejected
his doctrine, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>and by the wild licence of the Anabaptists,
whose madness could be traced to his impetus. Equally did Romanism gain
from the admission that freedom of profession was found to give outlets
for atheism; and from the open growth of Unitarianism which, taking
rise in Italy in the Lutheran period, was thence carried to Switzerland
and elsewhere, and made considerable headway in Poland. The younger
Socinus (Sozzini), who joined and developed the movement, was not its
founder even in Poland; but when modified and organized by him there it
received his name. The Socinian cult terrified many Protestants,
driving them back to the old ways; and it may have been partly the
resentful fear of such effects that led Calvin to commit his historic
crime of causing the Spaniard Servetus to be burned at the stake (1553)
for uttering Unitarian doctrine. But Calvin&rsquo;s language at every
stage of the episode, his heartless account of the victim&rsquo;s
sufferings, and his gross abuse of him afterwards, tell of the ordinary
spirit of the bigot&mdash;incensed at opposition and exulting in
vengeance.</p>
<p class="par">Where a scholar could so sink, the bulk of the
Protestant communities inevitably became fanatical and hard. In
Holland, where Calvin&rsquo;s church became that of the republic, it
treated Arminianism in the seventeenth century as itself had been
treated by Lutheranism in the sixteenth. Arminius (Jacobus Harmensen)
had sought in a halting fashion to modify the dogma of predestination,
and to prove that all men might repent and be saved. Dying after much
controversy (1609), he left a sect who went further than he; and the
strife came to the verge of civil war, the Arminian Barneveldt being
beheaded as a traitor (1619), and the illustrious Grotius sentenced to
perpetual imprisonment, from which however he contrived to escape. In
England in the next generation the Presbyterians, whose doctrine was
Calvinistic, showed the same tyrannous temper; the Arminian archbishop
Laud was no better; and in Calvinist Scotland and Lutheran Germany
alike the common people were similarly intolerant. Standing with their
leaders on the Bible as the beginning and end of truth, the Protestants
everywhere assumed infallibility, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>proceeded to decree
pains and penalties with a quite papal inhumanity. Had Luther been able
to give effect to his hatred of the Jews, they would have been
persecuted as they never had been&mdash;apart from the chronic
massacres&mdash;in the Catholic period. He would have left them neither
synagogues nor homes, neither books nor property. Thus taught,
Protestants became persecutors in mass.</p>
<p class="par">In particular, they everywhere turned with a new zest to
the burning of witches, the old superstitions being frightfully
reinforced by the newly current doctrine of the Pentateuch. No
argument&mdash;though it was tried by some&mdash;could countervail the
testimony of the Sacred Book against witchcraft, and its decree of the
death penalty. As the frenzy of witch-burning was equally intense in
the Catholic countries in the Lutheran period, the mania may be traced
in the first instance to the Inquisition, which made a specialty of
such action. But it is clear that the new study of the Bible in
Protestant countries gave it as strong a stimulus. In England and
Scotland, for instance, there had been very little witch-burning in the
Catholic period; and the first English law for the purpose was passed
under Henry VIII, in 1541; but in both countries the madness
thenceforth went step for step with the growth of Puritanism; and the
amount of insane cruelty caused by it is past human power to
realize.</p>
<p class="par">If the merits of Christianity as a civilizing force are
to be in any way determined by its influence in working bloodshed, its
record in the matter of witch-slaying alone would serve to place it, in
that regard, lower than any other creed. Classic paganism knew no such
infamy. All the horrors which Christians are wont to cite as typically
heathen, the legends of Juggernaut and the pictures of Dahomey, dwindle
in moral bulk beside the dreadful sum of evil set forth in the past of
their own faith. For the Protestant lands burned at least as many
hapless women for the imaginary crime of witchcraft as the Inquisition
burned men for heresy. Most of the victims were women whose sole
offence had been to have few friends. To be left a childless widow or
an old maid was to run the risk of impeachment as a witch by any
superstitious or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270"
name="pb270">270</a>]</span>malevolent neighbour; and the danger seems
to have been actually doubled when such a woman gave herself to the
work of rustic medicine-making in a spirit of goodwill to her kind.
Lonely women who suffered in their minds from their very loneliness
were almost sure to be condemned; and in cases where partial insanity
did not lead them to admit the insane charges against them, torture
easily attained the same end. But the mere repute for scientific
studies could bring a man to his death; and in Scotland a physician was
horribly tortured and at last burned on the charge of having raised the
storm which endangered the life of King James on his return voyage from
Denmark with his bride.</p>
<p class="par">The crowning touch of horror is the fact that in
Protestant history for generations there is hardly a trace of popular
compassion for the victims. In the north of Catholic Italy there was a
rebellion against witch-burning, perhaps because it was a part of the
machinery of the Inquisition; in the Protestant countries there was
nothing of the kind. Luther, a man normally fond of children, was
capable of advising that a &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; child should be
thrown into the river to drown or be cured. In Italy and France there
had always been skepticism on the matter among educated men; in the
Protestant world the new Bibliolatry made such skepticism go in fear of
its life. Wherever it arose, piety met it with the consciousness of
perfect wisdom, derived from revelation. Calvin was as confident on the
subject as Luther; and when Doctor John Wier of Cl&egrave;ves,
apparently a believer in demons, whose numbers he afterwards
statistically estimated at over seven thousand millions, ventured to
argue in 1563 that many of the so-called witches were simply lunatics,
he met as little favour in the Protestant as in the Catholic sphere. It
is to be remembered, as a landmark in intellectual history, that the
great French publicist Jean Bodin, the most original political thinker
of his age, and far from orthodox on the Christian creed, was the
foremost champion of the reigning superstition, which had become one of
his rooted prejudices.</p>
<p class="par">In England, in 1584, a notable book was written against
it, the <i>Discoverie of Witchcraft</i>, by Reginald Scot; but still
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>mania deepened. King James I caused Scot&rsquo;s
book to be burned by the hangman in the next generation; and the
superstition, thus accredited, reached its height in the period of the
Commonwealth, whereafter it declined in the skeptical era of the
Restoration. Nowhere did effective resistance arise on the religious
plane. The reaction was conspicuously the work of the skeptics, noted
as such. Montaigne began it in France, by the sheer force of his hardy
and luminous common sense, which made no account of either the theology
or the learning arrayed against it; and inasmuch as the most brutal
fanaticism was in this matter everywhere bound up with the popular
creed, the new enlightenment became in England anti-democratic because
democracy there was the power of persecution, as in France it became
anti-clerical. The Protestant movement had in its own despite set up a
measure of mental freedom, by breaking up the ecclesiastical unity of
Europe; but its spirit soon revealed to clear eyes that freedom of
thought was not to be reached by mere reform of the Church as such. It
thus evolved a skepticism which struck at the roots of all Christian
beliefs.</p>
<p class="par">The intellectual fatality of the Reformation was that it
set up against the principle of papal authority not that of private
judgment but that of revelation, and thus still made ancient ignorance
the arbiter in the deepest problems. It is indeed vain to say, with
Erasmus and with Goethe, that Luther did ill to force a crisis, and
that the reform of the Church should have been left to time and the
process of culture. No culture could have reformed the papacy as an
economic system: the struggle there was finally not between knowledge
and ignorance but between vested interests and outsiders&rsquo; rights.
In the Rome of Leo X, as Ranke has calculated, there were twenty-five
hundred venal offices, half of them created by Leo to raise funds for
the building of St. Peter&rsquo;s; and probably most were held by
cultured men. What they fought for was not dogma but revenue: Luther
when among them had been scandalized by their irreligion, not by their
superstition. Looking back, we may still say that a violent rupture was
inevitable. Two generations later, we find Pope Sixtus V
(1585&ndash;90) raising <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href=
"#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>money as did Leo X by the sale of
places, and putting the prices so high as to promote official
corruption in an extreme degree.</p>
<p class="par">Rome, as a city, lived on its ecclesiastical revenue,
and the total vested interest was irreversible. During the long papal
schism in which the main wealth of the Church went to the Popes of
Avignon, Rome sank visibly to the level of &ldquo;a town of
cowherds,&rdquo; and the old church of St. Peter&rsquo;s was in danger
of falling to pieces. From the middle of the fifteenth century to the
end of the sixteenth, the popes laboured successively to make their
city the most splendid in Europe; and only a great revenue, extorted by
corrupt or corrupting methods, could maintain it. The great Council of
Trent, begun in 1545 to reform and reorganize the Church, had
accomplished at its close in 1563 only a few doctrinal, disciplinary,
and hierarchical modifications; and its own history proved the
impossibility of a vital reform from within. Twice suspended for long
periods, on the pretext of the disturbed state of Europe, it revealed
in its closing session the inability of the nations as such to agree on
any curative policy. The emperor, Ferdinand I, called for many reforms
in a Protestant direction, such as marriage of priests, schools for the
poor, &ldquo;the cup for the laity,&rdquo; and the reform of convents;
and the French prelates supported him; but those of Spain violently
resisted, though they agreed in wishing to restrict the pope&rsquo;s
power; while the Italians, the most numerous party, stood by the pope
in all things, denouncing all gainsayers. In the end, the diplomatic
cardinal Morone arranged matters with the different courts; the bishops
had for the most part to give way; and the powers of the pope, which in
1545 the movers of the Council had been bent on curtailing, were
established in nearly every particular, without any important change
being made in the administrative system. The Council had indeed
repudiated the Lutheran and Calvinist doctrines of predestination to
sin and salvation; and on this head the Lutherans gradually came round
to the Catholic view; but on the side of Church government the
Reformation remained practically justified. Still, it is the historic
fact that its first general result was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>intellectual
retrogression. Save in England, where Elizabeth&rsquo;s irreligious
regimen gave scope for a literary and scientific renascence while it
correlatively humiliated religion and the Church, leaving the fanatical
growth of Protestantism to come later, the Protestant atmosphere was
everywhere one of theological passion and superstition, in which art
and science and fine letters were for a time blighted.</p>
<p class="par">And even in England, the result of plunging an ignorant
population into the turmoil of theological strife was markedly evil,
whatever countervailing force there was in the freer play of mental
life on other lines. Were it only in respect of the new ecclesiastical
quarrels, the fierce and scurrilous wrangles between prelatists and
anti-prelatists, the intensities of malice set up by questions of
vestments, the insoluble disputes over the meaning of the
eucharist&mdash;all heading towards the great Civil War of the
seventeenth century&mdash;the Reformation was a letting out of the
waters of enmity. But all intellectual life was bound to suffer from
the erection of a historic delusion into a popular code of moral and
social law. Men assured that the ethical and ceremonial law of the
ancient Hebrews was the beginning and end of all civic wisdom and
righteousness could not lead a sane civic life. The sermons of the
Reformers were vain asseverations of a non-existent moral order. All
social evil, all individual misfortune, was declared, in the Hebraic
manner, to be God&rsquo;s vengeance for sin; when all the while the
infliction of evil by persecutors was denounced as in itself sin
against God. The most popular preachers made the wildest promises of
material welfare to the faithful as the due reward of faith; and every
failure of fulfilment was as confidently explained in terms alternately
of divine benevolence and divine chastening. The most repellent
teachings of the Hebrew books were erected into infallible canons and
commands; and every contemporary problem was put on the rack of Hebrew
precedent. On all sides, the human soul was bewildered by unreason.</p>
<p class="par">No mode of mental activity could escape the play of
perversion. Hooker&rsquo;s appeal to reason in Church policy was
forever clouded by unreasoning resort to ancient texts. Bacon,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>complaining of the theological mortmain on all
mental life, tacitly endorsed it by using the same tactic. With such
standards in force at the upper levels of thought, a superstitious
populace invited to find its sole light in the half-comprehended lore
of ancient Palestine could make no progress on its own part towards
knowledge of nature, of man&rsquo;s past, or of man&rsquo;s
possibilities. Religious literature meant the semblance of culture
without the reality. The sole measurable gains were &aelig;sthetic, and
that mainly on the literary side; for the Biblical temper was hostile
to the plastic arts, though men of religion could not but play their
part in developing the instrument of language. Science was at a
discount till men wearied of theological debate.</p>
<p class="par">By reaction, some similar results accrued within the
scope of Catholicism in France and Italy. It is significant that
&ldquo;the importance of the anatomical description of the heart by
Vesalius was not thoroughly comprehended by investigators for
seventy-three years (1543 to 1616); and the uses of the valves of the
veins remained unknown for more than half a century.&rdquo; This was
the period of the wars of religion in France, and of the theologians in
Germany. Servetus had gone far on the way to the theory of the
circulation of the blood in his <i lang="la">Christianismi
Restitutio</i> (not in his work on the Trinity, as is often asserted),
but the fact remained absolutely unknown in Switzerland and Germany.
Scotland, which just before the Reformation had in the works of Dunbar
and Lyndsay what might have been the beginning of a great literature,
fell into a theological delirium which lasted two hundred years, and
from which the nation emerged with its literary and intellectual
continuity destroyed, and needing new tillage from foreign thought to
yield any new life. It was only after the period of devout
Protestantism had been succeeded by strife-weariness, toleration and
doubt, that Protestant Holland and Switzerland began to count for
anything in science and scholarship; and Germany and Scandinavia had to
wait still longer for a new birth.</p>
<p class="par">Catholic France, with all her troubles, fared on the
whole better in the mental life. Rabelais was for his country a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>fountain of riotous wisdom all through the worst
time of the civil wars; and before they had ended Montaigne began
effectually the new enlightenment. Only in England, where Shakespeare
and Bacon signalized Protestant rule, was there any similar good
fortune; and both in England and France the period was one of extensive
though necessarily cautious skepticism. Alongside of the first
stirrings of Protestantism there had arisen in France a spirit of
critical unbelief, represented by the <i>Cymbalum Mundi</i> of
Bonaventure des Periers (1537), who had set out as a Protestant; and
the ferocities of the war engendered in many a temper like his. What
Montaigne did was to give to practical skepticism the warrant of
literary genius, and to win for it free currency by the skill of his
insinuation. Without such fortunate fathering, rationalism in England
made much headway in the Elizabethan age. Shakespeare is deeply
impregnated with its spirit;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3726src" href=
"#xd21e3726" name="xd21e3726src">2</a> Bacon gave it a broad basis
under cover of orthodoxy; and even before their day there were loud
protests that atheism was on foot wherever continental culture
came.</p>
<p class="par">By such complainants the evil was early traced to Italy;
and it is clear that there, after the Spanish conquest, men&rsquo;s
energies turned from the closed field of politics to that of religion
and philosophy, despite the Inquisition, very much as men in ancient
Greece had turned to philosophy after the rise of the Macedonian
tyranny. From Italy came alike Deism and Unitarianism, and such atheism
as there was. The Inquisition still burned all heretics alike when it
could catch them; but even among the clergy, nay, among the very
inquisitors themselves, there were many heretics; and the zealots had
to call in lay bigots to help them. Heretical books were burned by the
thousand, most being absolutely suppressed; and when there was
established (about 1550) the famous <i>Index Expurgatorius</i>, in
imitation of the example already set at Louvain and Paris, it was soon
found that some works by cardinals, and by the framer of the first
Italian list, had to be included. Protestantism was thus crushed out in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>Italy, with due bloodshed to boot; and the
heretical Franciscans were forced in mass to recant; but in the end
there was no gain to faith. Heresy became more elusive and more
pervasive; and when in the year 1600 the papacy put to death Giordano
Bruno, his work as the herald of a new philosophy was already done. In
the next generation appeared Galileo, the pioneer of a new era of
practical science. Thus even in her time of downfall did Italy begin
for Europe a second renascence.</p>
<p class="par">Thenceforth, in the sphere of the Church of Rome,
unbelief persisted either audaciously or secretly alongside of the
faith. Within the Church the long battle with Protestantism had evolved
fresh energies of propaganda, and even a measure of ascetic
reformation. In particular, the new Order of Jesuits (founded in 1534),
which we have seen completing the recapture of Poland, strove
everywhere by every available means, fair and foul, for the
Church&rsquo;s supremacy. Where treachery and cruelty could not be
used, as they were in Poland, the Jesuits made play with a system of
education which realized the ideals of the time; and besides thus
training the young as adherents, the Church developed within itself a
revival of ecclesiastical learning that made a formidable resistance to
the learning of French and English Protestantism. In the latter half of
the seventeenth century the combatants thus wrought by their literary
warfare what they had previously done by their physical strife&mdash;a
gain to the spirit of unbelief. Neither side convinced the other; and
while the Protestants discredited many of the old Catholic beliefs,
their opponents more subtly discredited the faculty of theological
reason, putting all human judgments in doubt as such. The outcome was a
strengthening of the anti-theological bias. Jesuit education, where it
became at all scientific, armed the born skeptics; and where it was
limited to <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i> it failed in the long run to
make either earnest believers or able disputants.</p>
<p class="par">Thus the Reformation, in the act of giving Christianity
a new intensity of life among certain populations, where it fostered
and was fostered by a growth of intolerant democracy, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>unwittingly promoted at once fanaticism and
freethinking both in its own and in its enemy&rsquo;s sphere. Deepened
superstition forced a deepening of skepticism; fanaticism drove
moderate men to science; and theological learning discredited theology.
In papal and downtrodden Italy, in monarchic and military France, in
the England of the Restoration, and in semi-democratic Holland, there
worked in the seventeenth century the same divergent forces.</p>
<p class="par">In both Holland and England, by help of the spirit of
fanatical democracy, the multiplication of sects and heresies in the
second generation of the seventeenth century was so great&mdash;180
being specified in England alone&mdash;that no repressive policy could
deal with them; and under cover of their political freedom there arose
some Unitarian doctrine among the common people, even as
anti-Scriptural Deism spread among the educated. Devoutly religious
men, such as George Fox, the founder of Quakerism, by the very
thoroughness of their loyalty to the doctrine of the inward light,
helped to shake among sincere people the old docility of belief in
revelation, though in some cases they reinforced it, and in many more
evoked, by reaction, the spirit of persecution.</p>
<p class="par">The net gain from Protestantism thus lay in the
fortuitous disruption of centralized spiritual tyranny. The rents in
the structure made openings for air and light at a time when new
currents were beginning to blow and new light to shine. Twenty years
before Luther&rsquo;s schism, Columbus had found the New World.
Copernicus, dying in 1543, left his teaching to the world in which
Protestantism had just established itself. Early in the next century
Kepler and Galileo began to roll back for men the old dream-boundaries
of the universe. The modern era was at its dawn; and with it
Christianity had begun its era of reconsideration, revision, and slow
decline. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=

Sciences</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was primarily the growth of physical science,
from the middle of the sixteenth century, that gave solidity and
permanence to the new movements of rationalistic revolt aroused by the
spectacle of the Reformation and the strifes it engendered. That
spectacle, and in general the wars of religion which followed, tended
more to make scoffers or skeptics than to develop constructive
rationalism. One of the conclusions forced on statesmanlike minds by
the religious wars in France was that &ldquo;a peace with two religions
was better than a war with none&rdquo;; and the seventeenth century
there began with a strong though secretive tendency among the idle
classes to what in the next century became universally known as the
Voltairean temper. In the seventeenth, however, it was still almost
wholly denied the use of printing; and under this disadvantage it must
have fared ill were it not for the new studies which at once developed
and buttressed the spirit of inquiry. They built up a new habit of
mind, the surest obstacle to dogma.</p>
<p class="par">Were men wont to develop their beliefs logically, the
teaching of Copernicus alone, when once accepted, would have broken up
the orthodox faith, which at nearly every point implied the geocentric
theory. Giordano Bruno, recognizing this, wove on the one hand the
Copernican principle into his restatement of the ancient doctrine of
the infinity of the universe, and on the other hand derided alike
Catholicism and Protestantism. But a comprehensive philosophy is not
the kind of propaganda that first &ldquo;comes home to men&rsquo;s
business and bosoms&rdquo;: the line of practical disturbance lay
through exact science; and it is in the practical and experimental
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>work of Galileo that Copernicanism begins
(1616&ndash;38) strongly to stir the educated intelligence of Europe.
Bacon and Bodin, like Luther, had rejected it as theoretically
propounded. It was the telescopic discoveries of Galileo that staggered
the skeptics and alarmed the Church.</p>
<p class="par">The need for a solid discipline as a grounding for
rationalism is made clear by the aberrations of many of the earlier
religious doubters. Bodin, as we have seen, held fanatically by
witchcraft; and he likewise accepted astrology, as did many
half-developed Italian freethinkers who rejected the ideas of demons
and sorcery, and doubted much concerning the Bible. Men reasoned on
such matters by the light of their training, of what seemed to be
probability, and of scanty evidence, in matters where the traditional
hypotheses could be properly checked only by minute and patient
scrutiny. Thus the disbelievers in astrology were as a rule bigoted
Christians who, like Luther, merely rejected it as unscriptural, while
Melanchthon leant to the belief. Of the early English Protestants many
theologically rejected it as regards the moral life, while assenting to
the theory of astral influence on men&rsquo;s affairs in other regards.
Only with new science could come the rational challenge; and even men
like Bacon, who consciously strove after scientific method, remained
partly prepossessed by the old belief in astral forces. The word
&ldquo;influence,&rdquo; in this sense, constantly appears in all kinds
of Tudor and early Stuart literature.</p>
<p class="par">It has been said with broad truth that whereas Greece,
with her dialectic discipline, exhorted men to make their beliefs agree
with one another, and the Christian Church ordered them to make their
beliefs agree with her dogma, the modern spirit demands that beliefs
should agree with facts. Such a spirit first promoted and then was
immensely promoted by the study of natural science. Even in the Middle
Ages, as in antiquity, physicians were proverbially given to
irreligion; and the study of physics was still more conducive to
religious doubt than that of physic. In England the naturalistic
spirit, as we may term it, was notably popularized by Bacon in the
course of the seventeenth century, but the effectual growth of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>Protestant fanaticism began in his day, and had
to run its course before much energy was available for scientific
research; though both Gilbert the electrician and Harvey the discoverer
of the circulation of the blood belonged to Bacon&rsquo;s generation.
Only a small number of superior minds were capable of the scientific
attitude. But even before the Restoration educated Englishmen were
weary enough of strife to begin the gatherings which afterwards became
the Royal Society, devoted strictly to scientific inquiry, with a
positive veto on all theological discussion.</p>
<p class="par">To their scientific studies they had a powerful lead
from France, where Descartes had virtually begun a new era in
philosophy by his <i>Discourse on Method</i> (1637), a work which
professed allegiance to the Church but reversed all the Church&rsquo;s
methods; and where Gassendi, a truer if a less influential physicist
than Descartes, controverted the spiritualistic positions of the latter
in a singularly modern spirit of rationalism. By this time, too, had
begun to appear the impotence of the Church against the ubiquitousness
of modern heresy. She contrived to strike where she should have spared,
and to spare where she ought in consistency to have struck. Galileo was
probably, as he professed to be, an orthodox Catholic in his main
theological beliefs, yet he was persecuted by the Inquisition; and
though the story of his &ldquo;Still it moves&rdquo; is a fable, he was
forced to recant under threat of torture. Descartes, who protested his
loyalty to the Church, was at least a new support to theism; but
because his teachings were adopted in France by the Jansenists, the
quasi-Protestant enemies of the Jesuits within the Catholic Church,
they were ecclesiastically prohibited, and his supporters in the Church
and the university were persecuted; while the prudent Gassendi, who at
times reasons like an atheist, contrived without protestation to keep
on good terms with the Church, of which he was actually a Canon. He had
taken orders solely for the sake of an income; and he was never
disturbed, though he wrote a vindication of Epicurus, one of the most
nearly atheistical of the leading Greek philosophers.</p>
<p class="par">Nowhere is the new impulse to science more clearly seen
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>than in papal and Spanish-ruled Italy. There, as
Bacon complained was the case nearly everywhere throughout Europe, most
scientific professors were poorly paid, while the learned professions
were well endowed; yet at the close of the sixteenth century there did
not exist a single distinguished Greek scholar in the peninsula; and
while this may have been due to papal policy, the unfostered study of
the natural sciences went forward on all sides. Narrowly watched by the
Church, the students nevertheless propagated new science throughout
north-western Europe. Unhappily, as we have seen, the theological
spirit still hampered its evolution, but the study persisted.</p>
<p class="par">From the middle of the seventeenth century onwards it is
clear that physical science by its very method and character undermined
theology. Here there were possible rational proof and intelligent
agreement, instead of the eternal sterility of theological debate on
irrational propositions. In France, Holland, and England, the followers
of Descartes, even when agreeing on a fundamentally wrong theory of
cosmic physics, made for rationalism by their discipline as well as by
what was accurate in their detailed science; the influence of the
English Royal Society was recognizably anti-clerical; and from Gassendi
onwards the whole scientific movement told decisively against
superstition, so that the belief in witchcraft was discredited within a
generation from the time of its worst intensity. Glanvil, who in
England professed a scientific skepticism, on Cartesian lines, defended
the superstition as Bodin had done in France, and was supported not
only by the theologians but by such a pious man of science as the
chemist Boyle, who was equally skeptical in his own proper sphere; yet
they could not restore credulity among the thinking minds. More august
beliefs were shaken in turn. Boyle in his latter years set himself
anxiously to defend Christianity; and Newton was moved to exert himself
even in the cause of theism, which was newly undermined. But Newton
himself was a Unitarian; his distinguished contemporary the astronomer
Halley was reputed a thorough unbeliever; and Newton&rsquo;s own
philosophy, which proceeded on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282"
href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>Gassendi as well as on the
devout Kepler, was denounced by some, including the German Leibnitz, as
tending to atheism. Leibnitz in turn stood wearily aloof from the
Church in his own country. No personal bias or prejudice could cancel
the fundamental dissidence between exact science and
&ldquo;revealed&rdquo; dogma.</p>
<p class="par">While the literary movement of English Deism in the
eighteenth century was not ostensibly grounded on physical philosophy,
being rather critical and logical, it always kept the new science in
view; and the movement in France, as set up by the young Voltaire,
connected itself from the first with the Newtonian philosophy, which
there had to drive out the Cartesian, now become orthodox. In the hands
of La Mettrie biological science pointed to even deeper heresy; and for
such propagandists as Diderot and D&rsquo;Holbach all science was an
inspiration to a general rejection of religion. Even the pursuit of
mathematics developed pronounced unbelievers, such as D&rsquo;Alembert
and Condorcet. When, finally, in the latter half of the century the
scientific spirit flagged or stagnated in England, first by reason of
the new growths of industry and the new imperial expansion, later by
reason of reaction against the French Revolution, it was the French men
of science, in particular the astronomers and mathematicians, as
Laplace, Lagrange, Lalande, and Delambre, who carried on the profession
of rationalism. In particular, Laplace&rsquo;s great contribution, the
nebular hypothesis, clinched on non-theistic grounds the whole
development of modern astronomy; and the philosopher Kant, who on that
point had in a measure anticipated him, never conformed to Christian
orthodoxy even while glosing it in the effort to conserve theism.</p>
<p class="par">All the later generalizations of science have told in
the same way; and all have had to struggle for life against the
instinctive hostility of the Christian Churches, Protestant and
Catholic alike. Geology, after generations of outcry, made an end in
the nineteenth century of the orthodox theory of cosmic creation; the
evolution theory drove home the negation with a new constructive
doctrine; and Darwinism, after a no less <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>desperate contest,
has upturned the very foundations of Christian ethics as well as dogma.
As represented by Huxley, its chief polemist, it is definitely
non-Christian and non-theistic. It does not countervail this essential
tendency that a number of men of science in each generation profess to
adhere to Christianity. The adherence is seldom thorough, and when it
is, it is commonly recognized to stand for lack of culture on the
historical and ethical sides of the issue. The result is that
Protestant Christianity nearly everywhere capitulates outwardly to
natural science, professing still to save its own more essential
dogmas; while Catholicism forces upon its adherents either
&ldquo;scientific nescience&rdquo; or a dissimulation fatal to
zeal.</p>

Cosmic and Moral</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It lies on the face of our sketch of the movement
of physical science that it is subversive of Christian orthodoxy,
though not of extra-Christian theism. But since Giordano Bruno all
cosmic philosophy that keeps the tincture of religion has pointed to
pantheism; and all moral philosophy since Descartes has been more or
less fatally subversive of Christian dogma. In the great work of
Spinoza (1671), who partly proceeded on Descartes and partly
transcended him, we have a philosophy and an ethic that are reluctantly
pronounced by respectful theists to be virtually atheistic; and no
great philosophy since has reversed that impetus. The God of Kant and
the God of Hegel are as non-Christian as the Absolute of Bradley.</p>
<p class="par">Moral philosophy had begun to be non-theological in
Montaigne&rsquo;s day (1580); and his disciple, Charron, constructed in
his <i>Wisdom</i> what is pronounced to be the first modern treatise on
that footing. Less than a century later the English Cumberland,
although a bishop of the Church, took a similarly rationalistic course
in morals in his reply to Hobbes (1672), making no appeal to
revelation, though of course making no attack on it; and the almost
undisguised naturalism of Hobbes was thus tacitly countenanced in
fundamentals from the clerical side, in the very act of repudiation.
Shaftesbury, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>who became the most influential moralist of the
first half of the eighteenth century, did but develop the naturalistic
principle on avowedly theistic and non-Christian lines. Bishop
Berkeley, who assailed both Spinoza and Shaftesbury, could justify his
Christian beliefs only by arguing that skeptics themselves, in the
study of mathematics, accepted many arbitrary propositions, and might
as well accept the mystery of Jesus Christ. Even Locke, though he stood
for a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and non-dogmatic Christianity, was in
effect an influence for deism in respect of his philosophy.</p>
<p class="par">All later moral philosophy of any standing has been
either plainly non-evangelical or essentially irreconcilable with the
Christian faith. Even the argumentation of Bishop Butler (1736) has no
more validity for it than for any other, and is finally as favourable
to atheism as to theism. Hume, who developed from deism into a final
agnosticism, was at all stages anti-Christian in his ethic as well as
in his metaphysic and his historical criticism of religion; and Adam
Smith was strictly deistic. The later and deeper German philosophies of
Kant and Fichte are no more truly helpful to Christianity, though
elaborate attempts have been made to adapt Kantism to its service; and
though Hegel finally proposed to rehabilitate its dogmas, his German
disciples for the most part became anti-Christian; one of them,
Feuerbach, becoming one of the most formidable critics of the faith.
The professionally Christian moral philosophies, such as that of Paley
in England (1785), have been abandoned by the sincerely religious no
less than by the students of philosophy. Coleridge, seeking to give a
philosophic aspect to the faith of his latter years, had to fall back
on the &ldquo;modal&rdquo; Trinity, and could make no judicial defence
of the doctrines of salvation and damnation.</p>
<p class="par">In the latter half of the nineteenth century, finally,
the balance of philosophic thought has been overwhelmingly hostile to
Christian beliefs. Everywhere, whether it be professedly utilitarian or
&ldquo;transcendental,&rdquo; it is essentially monistic and
evolutionist; and while the expressly naturalistic doctrine, typified
in the teaching of Spencer, positively rejects all pretence of
revelation, the spiritistic schools do nothing for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>historic religion beyond claiming to have
reinstated a theism which is not &ldquo;providential,&rdquo; and so
amounts in practice to pantheism. The so-called materialism of Germany,
represented by the writings of Moleschott and B&uuml;chner, though
constantly assailed on metaphysical grounds, is the common-sense
conviction of millions of educated men; and the metaphysical attack
makes scarcely a pretence of claiming belief for conventional religion.
Christianity thus subsists without anything that can properly be
described as philosophic support, save as regards some Catholic systems
which rationalists or men of science rarely take the trouble to
examine, and the sentimental mode of reasoning latterly labelled
Pragmatism. This is really an unwarrantable application of a term which
its framer, Mr. C. S. Pierce, applied to a practice of testing beliefs
by ascertaining how far they are acted on in life. The so-called
&ldquo;Pragmatism&rdquo; of Professor William James and Mr. Schiller is
the vitally different process of certificating beliefs as true by the
amount of comfort and stimulus derived from them. This procedure Mr.
Pierce repudiates; but the bulk of current &ldquo;Pragmatism&rdquo;
flies that flag, and not his.</p>
<p class="par">That method logically concludes nothing for or against
any belief, but may be made to seem to support almost any. It posits,
in effect, that true beliefs are those by which men can successfully
live, but offers no test of the reality of any alleged grounding of
life upon a belief. Empirically, the negative of any opinion may thus
be as easily substantiated as the affirmative, since the naturalist and
the supernaturalist may alike claim individual success and
satisfaction; and the adherents of the different faiths may do as much.
For the &ldquo;Pragmatist&rdquo; of this order, accordingly, two
contraries may be equally &ldquo;true.&rdquo; Any resort to objective
tests, the method of science, puts that of Pragmatism (of this order)
out of action. It has thus no philosophic significance save as a
quasi-philosophical reaffirmation of the pietist claim of
&ldquo;experience,&rdquo; and leaves religion as it found it.</p>
<p class="par">Other quasi-philosophical defences of Christianity are
even less durable. A considerable amount of temporary favour has been
won by what may be termed the Irrationalist defence, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>typified by the works of Mr. Benjamin Kidd and
Mr. A. J. Balfour. As put by the former, it is a suicidal process of
reasoning against reliance on reason, the necessary effect being to
discredit the verdict claimed, as being attainable only through the
very act of reason that is condemned. As more subtly handled by Mr.
Balfour, the Irrationalist case takes the form of a denial that
scientific beliefs, so-called, are any more capable of &ldquo;ultimate
proof&rdquo; than the beliefs which constitute religion. We have here a
very modern reversion to the orthodox forensic method anciently pursued
by Cicero, and in later times employed by Huet, Pascal, and Berkeley.
Its complete practical failure in all ages might serve to indicate its
necessary nugatoriness to those who most affect it. Were the central
thesis true, there is obviously no more warrant on that basis for any
one creed than for any other; and a &ldquo;solipsism&rdquo; which
warrants any and every claim alike is of no use to the Christian
Church, which seeks to warrant a given revelation. Whatever be their
abstract right to certainty, most men in search of it inevitably test
the less certain proposition in the light of the more certain: and this
bias, bound up with all sincere mental life, is as fatal to
anti-critical defences as it is vital to all scientific advance. An
inquiring age is not to be made credulous by the argument from
nescience.</p>

Historical Criticism</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Most men, in short, accept or reject religious
creeds on the strength not of any systematically philosophic reasoning,
but of either emotional bias or common-sense examination of concrete
evidence. The former is as a rule, though not always, susceptible of
influence from the latter. Thus the main instruments in turning men
from Christian credences have been the documentary and historical forms
of criticism.</p>
<p class="par">Such criticism, secretly frequent among educated men in
the sixteenth century, never ventured into print till the seventeenth,
and even then did so very circumspectly. English Deism begins its
literary existence with Lord Herbert of Cherbury, whose first work,
produced under French influences, appeared in Latin in 1624. His
position was that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287"
name="pb287">287</a>]</span>the doctrine of forgiveness for faith is
immoral; that all pretences of revelation are repugnant to moral
reason; and that as all so-called revelations are sectarian and
mutually exclusive, human reason must proceed for itself on a basis of
natural theism. Such audacity was possible in virtue partly of the
resort to Latin, partly of the high personal standing of the writer.
The next outstanding anti-Christian work is the <i>Leviathan</i> (1651)
of Hobbes, who ventured to publish in English under the doctrinally
tolerant rule of Cromwell. In his treatise, not only is the attitude of
faith constantly disparaged, despite constant resort to scriptural
citation, but there is a beginning of open criticism of the
inconsistencies of the Pentateuch. Such criticism seems to have gone
much further in private discussion long before that time; and it is
clear from many apologetic treatises that doctrinal unbelief was
abundant; but the publication of a skeptical work that could be read by
the unlearned marks an era of germinating unbelief. Spinoza&rsquo;s
<i>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</i> (1670) carries the principle of
rational textual criticism of the Bible further; and after the French
Catholic professor Richard Simon had published in French his critical
treatises on the texts of the Old and New Testaments (1678 and 1689),
though these were professedly orthodox, Biblical criticism began a new
life.</p>
<p class="par">The first drastic attacks of a direct and businesslike
kind on orthodoxy were those of the English Deists of the early years
of the eighteenth century, typified in the works of Anthony Collins,
who soberly and amiably called in question alike revelation, prophecy,
and miracles. Soon such criticism was reinforced by the inquiry of
Middleton into Roman Catholic miracles, on lines which implicitly
called in question those of the gospels; and the essay of Hume on
miracles in general put the case against them on grounds which could be
turned only by arguments that evaded them. The polemic of the whole
French school of freethinkers, headed by Voltaire, thereafter attacked
every aspect of Jewish and Christian supernaturalism and of Jewish and
Christian history considered as a moral dispensation; the English
Unitarians, represented by Priestley, made a number of converts to
their compromise; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288"
name="pb288">288</a>]</span>and when Gibbon came to deal with the rise
of Christianity in his great work (1776&ndash;88), he set forth on
naturalistic grounds a tentative sociological explanation which could
not be overthrown by orthodox methods, and is to be superseded only by
a more searching analysis on the same lines. So decisive was the total
effect of the critical attack that in the last quarter of the
eighteenth century many German theologians within the Church had begun
to deal with the supernatural elements in the Old Testament on
rationalistic though temporizing methods, and some had even begun to
apply the same treatment to the New. Finally came, in England, the
powerful common-sense attack of Thomas Paine (1793), which at once set
up a movement of popular rationalism that has never since ceased.</p>
<p class="par">To all such rationalism, however, a strong check was set
up for a whole generation, especially in England, by the universal
reaction against the French Revolution. Hitherto the upper classes,
there as in France, had been noted mainly for unbelief in religious
matters; but when it was seen from the course of the Revolution that
heterodoxy could join hands with democracy, there was a rapid change of
front, on the simple ground of class interest. During the first
generation of the nineteenth century, accordingly, all English
freethinking was either driven under the social surface or classed as
disreputable, so that it was possible to assume a great revival of
faith. In France, similarly, the literary pietism of Chateaubriand
seemed to have crowned with success the official restoration of the
Church&rsquo;s authority; and even the intellectual revival was
associated with Christian zeal on the part of such energetic
personalities as Guizot. Even in Germany, though there the work of
Biblical criticism on rationalist lines went steadily on, there was a
pietist revival. Before the middle of the century was reached, however,
it was clear that in France and Germany rationalism was in full
renascence; and in England, where such facts are less readily avowed,
scholarly writings even in the fourth decade had begun to prove the
solidarity of European culture.</p>
<p class="par">As regards Biblical criticism, there appears to be a
certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>periodicity of action. In the eighteenth
century, when the work done was mainly of the common-sense order, the
French physician Jean Astruc laid down a basis for exact documentary
analysis by pointing to the two elements of Yahwist (Jehovist) and
Elohist narrative as indicating two distinct sources. On such lines the
earlier German scholars of the nineteenth century long laboured, till
the common-sense criticism was lost sight of. In the meantime, however,
a long line of partially rationalist criticism of the New Testament
culminated in the <i>Life of Jesus</i> by Strauss; and educated
Christendom was shaken to its foundations, insofar as it ventured to
read. Side by side with that of Strauss, there proceeded in Germany a
great movement of documentary and historical analysis, till
professional theology there became almost identified with the surrender
of Christian supernaturalism.</p>
<p class="par">As the critical movement proceeded in England it came
about that an admired dignitary of its Church, Bishop Colenso, was
convinced on common-sense lines of the utterly unhistorical character
of the main Pentateuchal narrative, and courageously published his
views (1862). From that point the European criticism of the Old
Testament, which had been proceeding on the assumption of the
genuineness of the narrative, took a new course with such rapid success
that within a generation the whole mass of the Old Testament had been
either decisively or provisionally reduced, chiefly by Dutch and German
scholars, to a variety of sources never wholly in accordance with the
traditional ascription, and representing collectively a vast historical
process of fabrication. In the face of the facts, the claim of
&ldquo;inspiration&rdquo; still made for the books by some of the
scholars who expound the process of their composition is naturally
treated with indifference by educated men not professionally committed
to such a position.</p>
<p class="par">With whatever bias the problem be approached, all really
critical study of the documents latterly tells against the Christian
position. Writers who, like Renan, have treated Christian origins in a
spirit of literary sympathy with that of belief, none the less undo
faith, and offer at best a sentimental historical construction in place
of the destroyed tradition. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href=
"#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>The orthodox defence, on the other
hand, grows rapidly less confident in the hands of scholarly men. The
later development of professional study, as set forth in the English
<i lang="la">Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i> shows a progressive
collapse of the traditional belief on almost every detail, some
continental theologians now going further in their rejection of it than
many professed rationalists.</p>
<p class="par">The general result of two generations of critical
research and controversy is that practically all Biblical students have
accepted the main results of the &ldquo;higher criticism,&rdquo;
whatever debate there may still be over details. There is tacit or
overt agreement that the Hexateuch is a composite body of writings of
many periods; that the Mosaic authorship is a myth; that the
quasi-historical books are similarly works of redaction; that the
Psalms are not Davidic and the Solomonic books not Solomonic; and that
the prophets are endlessly manipulated. Even the view that all the
prophets are post-Maccabean finds some acceptance. And the dissolution
of the Old Testament tradition necessarily involves the New. Though the
rigorous documentary analysis of that lagged behind the criticism of
the Hebrew books, the general conceptions of miracles and of
inspiration have long lacked serious defence. Arnold&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Miracles do not happen&rdquo; startled only those who had been
inattentive to the whole movement of scientific and historical
thought.</p>
<p class="par">To-day it can hardly be said that there is any serious
defence of New Testament supernaturalism. Some years ago a large number
of Anglican clerics signed a memorial calling for a liberal attitude
towards all historical criticism of the texts, and this was followed by
an appeal to the Bishop of London asking that belief in the Virgin
Birth should no longer be required of candidates for holy orders. The
appeal was of course refused; but no competent inquirer doubts that
hundreds of clergymen of the orthodox Churches are Unitarian in their
beliefs. Living controversy now turns, not on the supernaturalism of
the gospels, but on the purely historical question as to whether the
Gospel Jesus ever lived; and over this issue Unitarians are found to be
as resentful as Trinitarians <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href=
"#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>ever were on the Unitarian issue.
In Germany the debate has gone far, some of the more open-minded
theologians admitting that the old lines of defence must be abandoned
as inadequate. In England all critical processes take place more
slowly, but there is now accumulating a defensive literature which
tells of widespread unsettlement. The method of confident bluster is
found not to avail in an age which has seen the rapid abandonment of so
many vital positions, all in their time maintained with the same
contemptuous confidence.</p>
<p class="par">The average layman has of course not yet been reached by
such a problem as that of the Historicity of Jesus; but he has long
been well accustomed to the defensive attitude in matters of faith.
Down to the time of Colenso the &ldquo;sensations&rdquo; of the
controversy were over the books which attacked. For a generation past
the attack has been so general that the new &ldquo;sensations&rdquo;
were those set up by new attempts at defence or counter-attack. Such
books as the late Henry Drummond&rsquo;s <i>Natural Law in the
Spiritual World</i>, Mr. Benjamin Kidd&rsquo;s <i>Social Evolution</i>,
and Mr. Balfour&rsquo;s <i>Foundations of Belief</i>, in their turn
elicited an amount of excitement which told chiefly of eagerness for
weapons of defence against the rationalist invasion. None of the works
named will bear any critical scrutiny. Drummond&rsquo;s was repented of
by its author, as it well might; and the irrationalism of Mr. Kidd and
Mr. Balfour soon ceased to comfort the clergy who hastily hailed it as
a means of stablishing the faith.</p>
<p class="par">What subsists is the mass of mainly conventional,
formal, and uncritical orthodoxy, the custom of the majority, which
stands for the same mental inertia as preserved ancient paganism
substantially intact for five hundred years after Socrates, and enabled
its traditional polytheism to overgrow early Christianity. And the
professional defence to-day is at many points singularly like that put
forward for pagan polytheism by the Platonists and Neo-Platonists. At
its best it is certainly not more philosophical than the performance of
Plotinus; at its worst not more hollow than the performance of Cicero.

Christianity</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">All through the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, and till near the end of the eighteenth, the masses of
Europe remained attached to their respective Churches in despite of the
play of criticism among the more instructed. Whether popular religion
be regarded as a matter of habit and superstition or as the expression
of a higher happiness in religious rites, it has unquestionably
numbered the great majority down till recent times. How the Catholic
Church recovered large parts of Germany, practically all Poland and
Bohemia, and for a time the complete control of France, we have seen.
Within her sphere popular conduct was certainly no worse than in the
age of her undivided power; and where she could number within her fold
minds like Paolo Sarpi, the historian of the Council of Trent, in the
sixteenth century; like Pascal and F&eacute;nelon and Bossuet in the
seventeenth; and like Vico in the eighteenth, though in hardly any case
are such leading spirits found to be in thorough harmony with the papal
system, she could not but hold the respect of a great body even of
educated people.</p>
<p class="par">Her swarms of missionaries, too, seemed for a time to
have begun a new era of Catholic expansion in Asia and America, finding
footing in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Japan, China,
India, Siam, Tonkin, as well as in North and South America. Sent forth
by the College of Propaganda (<i lang="la">Congregatio de Propaganda
Fide</i>) founded in 1622, they displayed a zeal never surpassed in the
Church&rsquo;s history. In Japan and China, in particular, they had for
a time a dazzling success, largely through the address of the
Jesuits&mdash;whose policy was to win converts by identifying
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>native rites and beliefs with Christian, never
openly assailing but always seeking to assimilate them. As early as
1549, Francis Xavier had preached the faith in Japan, and at the
beginning of the seventeenth century it seemed likely to become the
religion of the State. But Christians undid the Christian cause.
Between the various orders of Catholic missionaries there were always
deadly jealousies, all the others denouncing the Jesuits, who in turn
charged incompetence and malevolence on all; and the increasing
arrogance of the propagandists in Japan gave colour to the hints of the
Protestant traders, Dutch and English, that Catholic missions were a
prelude to Catholic conquest. The Japanese emperor, accordingly, began
a great persecution in 1587, and during a number of years the Christian
converts were slaughtered by tens of thousands. Still the Jesuits
persevered; but in the next generation persecution began afresh. At
length, in 1637, by a supreme effort, the weakened Catholic flock were
wholly destroyed or expelled. Once more it had been demonstrated that
really determined and rigorous persecution by a majority in power can
eradicate the Christian or any other religion in a given sphere.</p>
<p class="par">In Siam in the next century a slight success was
similarly followed by expulsion; and in China, where an outward success
had been won as a sequel to the expansion in Japan, and where the
Christian cause subsisted longer, despite some persecution and despite
the fierce dissensions of the different orders on points both of
doctrine and corporate conduct, it dwindled in the eighteenth century.
The success, indeed, had been all along illusory, as the Chinese had
adapted rather than adopted Christian forms, and merely carried on
their usual rites under Christian auspices. When, accordingly, the
rival orders at length forced on the papacy, in the teeth of the
Jesuits, a decision as to whether Chinese Christians should or should
not truly conform to Christian doctrine, and a decision against the
Jesuits was given, the semblance of conversion melted away, and a
reversion to Jesuit methods could not restore it. A similar decision
made an end of a rather flourishing movement of Jesuit Brahmanism in
India about the middle of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294"
href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>eighteenth century; and the
other labours of the Catholic missionaries in India were undone by the
cruelties of their own Inquisition.</p>
<p class="par">Jesuitism had by this time been convicted of aiming in
the old fashion at its own worldly wealth, of troubling by its
political plottings the peace of every country it could enter, and of
setting up its own ambitions against the papal authority. In the East
it had become a great wealth-hunting corporation; in South America it
was the same, contriving for some generations to govern Paraguay in
particular wholly for its own enrichment; in Europe it provoked every
Catholic government in turn by its audacious attempts to control them.
Thus it was expelled from Portugal in 1759, from France in 1762, from
Bohemia in 1766; from Spain, Genoa, and Venice in 1767; and from
Naples, Malta, and Parma in 1768. At length, in 1773, the Society was
suppressed by a papal bull, and though it was revived in the nineteenth
century it has never since been the power it was, whether for evil or
for good.</p>
<p class="par">Of her extensions beyond Europe there thus remained
substantially to the Church of Rome at the end of the eighteenth
century only the Catholic populations of Central and South America and
Canada; and at the outbreak of the French Revolution, marked as it was
by the wholesale abjurations of Catholic priests and populace, it might
have seemed as if the reign of Rome in Europe were coming to an end.
The political movement, however, had outrun the educational; and as we
have seen, there was even a literary reaction at the Restoration. In
Italy, where the revolutionary movement had been hostile to the Church,
the reaction after 1815 was very marked. All criticism of Catholicism
was made a penal offence, and in the Kingdom of Naples alone, in 1825,
there were twenty-seven thousand priests, eight thousand nuns, as many
monks, twenty archbishops, and seventy-three bishops. In Spain and
France, too, the clergy worked hard to recover authority over the
people; and in Catholic Ireland they had never lost it, despite all the
efforts of Protestantism.</p>
<p class="par">Everywhere, however, save in America, the struggle for
existence has gone against Catholicism in the nineteenth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>century. Catholic Ireland has been in large
measure depopulated through the failure of Protestant England to solve
its economic problems; and though this means a gain to Romanism in the
United States, there is no great likelihood that that is permanent, or
that Catholicism there will ever be very docile to the papacy. France
has become gradually more rationalistic, so much so that the municipal
government of Paris is usually in the hands of freethinkers; and the
recent expulsion of the recalcitrant religious orders has proved the
determination of the republican majority to put down clerical
influence. The movement of anti-theological Positivism, founded by the
teaching of Auguste Comte (d. 1857) on bases laid by Saint-Simon, has
never been numerically strong, but has affected all French thought; and
to-day there is scarcely one eminent French writer who professes
religious opinions. Even in Spain, so long the stronghold of the faith,
and still more generally in Italy, educated men are as a rule either
indifferent or hostile to the Church; and the common people, especially
the Socialists in the towns, have gone the same way. Both in Spain and
Portugal there are journals zealously devoted to a propaganda of
freethought; and the judicial murder of Ferrer has but intensified
hostility to the Church. National union in Italy, accomplished in the
middle of the century, has been fatal to ecclesiastical supremacy. The
papacy is unable to recover its temporal power at Rome. In Catholic
Belgium, the action of the clergy is constantly fought by a ubiquitous
freethought propaganda; and Dutch Catholicism does not gain ground.</p>
<p class="par">Some appearance of Catholic revival occurred in England
in the second and third generations of the nineteenth century, the
&ldquo;Oxford movement&rdquo; preparing the ground; but though John
Henry Newman was followed into the Catholic Church by a number of
clergymen and rich laymen, the movement soon ceased to be
intellectually important, and the popular success seems to have reached
its limits. Though there is much leaning to Rome in the High Church
section of the heterogeneous Anglican body, it is certain that while
the economic basis remains Protestant there will be no great secession.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>Economic considerations, again, have latterly
set up even in Catholic Austria&mdash;which with Southern Germany is
perhaps the most believing section of the Catholic world&mdash;a
movement with the watchword &ldquo;Loose from Rome.&rdquo; In Brazil,
again, there has been a quite extraordinary development of Positivism
among the educated class; and the revolution which peacefully expelled
the last emperor&mdash;himself personally estimable, and not an
orthodox Catholic&mdash;was ostensibly wrought by the Positivist party.
Portugal, finally, has taken the same path.</p>
<p class="par">Thus the age which saw the promulgation of the formal
decree of Papal Infallibility (1870) has seen the most vital decline
that has ever taken place in the total life and power of the Church of
Rome. It preserves its full hold to-day only on (1) the most ignorant
or most rural sections of the population of Catholic countries, (2) the
unintellectual sections of their middle and upper classes, and (3) the
emotionally religious or pietistic types, who are still, by reason of
the total circumstances, more numerous among women than among men.
Hence in the Catholic countries, female education being there specially
backward, the Church depends relatively even more on women than do the
churches of the Protestant world. But among women in the Catholic
countries also there goes on a process of rationalization, Socialism
doing some of the work of education where the other machinery is
inadequate.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The failure of Protestantism to gain any ground in
Europe after the sixteenth century had naturally the effect of
increasing the zeal of its adherents within their own sphere; and
though nowhere did Protestant organization compare in energy with that
shown by the Society of Jesus and the Roman College of Propaganda, the
system of popular education in several countries&mdash;as Switzerland,
Scotland, and parts of Germany&mdash;was raised much above the popular
Catholic level. Presbyterians in particular felt the need of popular
schools for the maintenance of their polity. The result was, after a
time, a certain improvement in the capacity and conditions of the
common <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>people where other causes did not interfere.
Thus the Protestant cantons of Switzerland have in general been noted
for a greater material prosperity than that of the Catholic cantons;
and in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Presbyterian Scotland,
though naturally much the poorer country, admittedly turned out a
larger proportion of men qualified for responsible positions than did
episcopalian England.</p>
<p class="par">All the while, the influence of a Presbyterian clergy,
in touch with the people and able to ostracize socially those who
avowed unbelief, maintained in the Calvinistic countries a higher
average of professed orthodoxy, the normal effect of higher education
being thus checked on the side of religion. Scotland contributed little
to the earlier deistic movement of the eighteenth century, Smith and
Hume having taken it up after it had flourished for a generation in
England; and at no time was rationalism socially avowed to the same
extent in the north as in the south, the enlightenment of the lay
authors being confined to a small town circle.</p>
<p class="par">On the moral and &aelig;sthetic side, however, popular
Presbyterianism tended to be hard and joyless, with the natural result,
seen alike in Geneva and in Scotland, of breeding much licence. On the
other hand there arose a higher reaction, towards intellectual
interests; and the Switzerland of the eighteenth century produced a
remarkably large proportion of scientific men; while in Scotland, where
centuries of theological life and strife set up even in the Church a
notable spirit of &ldquo;moderation,&rdquo; both the physical and the
moral or social sciences were conspicuously cultivated. Popular
freethinking was beginning to follow in both cases, when the reaction
against the French Revolution arose to arrest it. When in the next
generation there began in Scotland the ecclesiastical struggle which
ended in the formation of the Free Church (1842) a new impulse was
given to doctrinal fanaticism, which the competition of three rival
Presbyterian Churches was well fitted to maintain.</p>
<p class="par">Thus, though Scottish scholars have contributed largely
to the &ldquo;higher criticism,&rdquo; the middle and working classes
of Scotland all through the nineteenth century have been at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>least outwardly more orthodox than even those of
England. They, too, however, have begun to exhibit the common critical
tendencies. As the results of Biblical criticism become more generally
known, church attendance tends to fall off, despite the economic
pressure Churchmen are able to use in small communities. It is perhaps
as much on account of the common need as by reason of the growth of
liberality that the two chief dissenting Scottish Churches, the Free
and the United Presbyterian (Voluntary), have latterly amalgamated.
Were it not that a large proportion of the more energetic and stirring
youth of the country leave it for England and the colonies, the more
conservative staying at home, the process of change would probably be
more rapid.</p>
<p class="par">In the small communities of Protestant Switzerland a
democratic church polity had equally served to maintain a greater
stress of orthodox belief and practice than was seen in surrounding
countries; and the appointment of Strauss to a chair of theology at
Zurich by a Radical Government in 1839 led to an actual insurrection,
set up and led by fanatical clergymen. Catholic cantons later showed
themselves no less medieval. Nothing, however, avails to shut out
critical thought; Zeller received a chair at Berne in 1847; rationalism
has ever since steadily progressed; the number of theological students
as steadily falls off; and among the Swiss theologians of to-day are
some of the most &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; of the professional writers
on Christian origins. Popular rationalism necessarily begins to follow,
though less rapidly than in countries where the people and the clergy
do not ecclesiastically govern themselves.</p>
<p class="par">In Protestant Holland and the Scandinavian States, of
late years, the decline of Christian faith has been still more marked.
All are considerably influenced by German culture; and in Protestant
Germany orthodoxy is gradually disappearing. There the long depression
of civilization begun by the troubles of the Reformation, and clinched
by the vast calamity of the Thirty Years War, was favourable to a
sombre religious feeling; and this, under the name of Pietism, actually
prevailed in the latter part of the seventeenth century, triumphing
over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>a movement of spontaneous freethinking. Peace
and the development of universities thereafter built up a learned
class, who especially cultivated ecclesiastical history; and as we have
seen, German theology had become in the primary sense rationalistic by
the end of the eighteenth century. After the fall of Napoleon there
began in earnest the education of the Prussian common people; and
though to this day the learned class are more apart from the general
public in Germany than in most other countries, the latter half of the
nineteenth century has seen a great development of popular
secularism.</p>
<p class="par">In 1881 the church accommodation in Berlin sufficed for
only two per cent of the population, and even that was not at all fully
used. This is the social aspect of Protestant Germany; and it
effectively confutes the periodic statements as to revivals of
orthodoxy in the universities. Such revivals are officially engineered
and financially stimulated: the mass of the people of Protestant
Germany, at least in the towns, have practically given up the Christian
creed, even when they do not renounce their nominal membership in the
State Church; and the great Socialistic party, which contains over
three millions of adult males, is pronouncedly rationalistic. In
Scandinavia the literary influence of such masters of drama and fiction
as Ibsen and Bj&ouml;rnson creates a freethinking spirit on a very wide
scale among the middle classes, though the clergy are still illiberal;
and in Holland, where the churches are increasingly latitudinarian,
there has been a more competent journalistic propaganda of rationalism
than in almost any other country.</p>
<p class="par">That the same general movement of things goes on in
England may be proved by reference to the almost daily complaints of
the clergy. Rationalism and secularism have advanced in all classes
during half a century, until their propaganda is accepted as a quite
normal activity; such writers as Spencer, Darwin, Huxley, and Clifford
being read by the more studious of all ranks. In recent years the cheap
reprints of the Rationalist Press Association have had millions of
readers. Churchgoing constantly declines in the towns; agnosticism
becomes more and more common among the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>educated classes; the
average of the workers in the large towns are fixedly alienated from
the Church; and the latter-day propaganda of the Salvation Army affects
only the less intelligent types even since, after refusing for twenty
years to deal with material problems, it has sought to establish itself
as a charitable organization for dealing with the &ldquo;lapsed
masses.&rdquo; As regards the general influence of the churches it is
observable that whereas fifty years ago there were many clergymen and
prelates noted as important writers on non-theological matters, and
whereas even a few years ago there were still several bishops
distinguished as scholars and historians, there is now none so
describable. So, in the department of fine letters, there is scarcely a
poet or novelist of high standing who can be called a believing
Christian. In the last generation some distinguished men who were
openly heterodox, as the late Mr. Matthew Arnold, or very dubiously
orthodox, as Mr. Lecky, were wont to profess themselves good members of
the Church of England; but the normal tendency of rationalists is now
to give the churches up. The leading names in serious and even
imaginative literature, with a few exceptions which stand for
popularity rather than weight, are those of known unbelievers. In that
category stood the late Mr. George Meredith.</p>
<p class="par">Of the state of thought in the United States it is
difficult to speak with precision. The latitude allowed to or taken by
the majority of the clergy keeps within the ostensible pale of the
numerous churches much opinion that elsewhere would rank as extremely
heterodox; and it was from American churchmen that there came the
project of the so-called &ldquo;Rainbow Bible,&rdquo; in which the
heterogeneous sources of the Old Testament books are indicated by
printing in variously coloured inks. As in all countries where the
clergy are democratically in touch with the people, the breach between
authority and modern thought is thus less marked than in the sphere of
the Catholic and Anglican Churches. But in such a civilization,
development is inevitably continuous.</p>
<p class="par">In the first half of the nineteenth century the
prevailing creed of educated New England, then noted for &ldquo;plain
living <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>and high thinking,&rdquo; was Unitarianism. This
seems to have grown rapidly after the Revolution, partly from seed sown
by Priestley, who made New England his home, partly from the Deism of
the educated class. Nearly all the leaders of the
Revolution&mdash;Washington, Paine, Franklin, Jefferson,
Adams&mdash;had been Deists. But Deism is an inconvenient creed for
public men in a church-going or clerically-influenced world; and
Unitarianism, with its decorous worship and use of the Bible, was a
convenient compromise. Later &ldquo;transcendental&rdquo; teaching,
such as the movement around Emerson, led men in the same direction.
Latterly, however, the Unitarian congregations relatively dwindle; and
while some of the defection stands for the relapse of the children from
the strenuous thought of their fathers, some stands for complete
abandonment of the habit of worship.</p>
<p class="par">At the same time popular rationalism has been greatly
diffused in the United States by the lecturing of the late Colonel
Ingersoll, one of the greatest orators of his time, as was his
contemporary Charles Bradlaugh in England. Each of those men probably
convinced more of his fellow countrymen of the untruth of the Christian
creed than were ever rationally persuaded of its truth by the preachers
or teachers of modern times. What preserves the form of faith in the
States is probably less the socio-economic pressure seen so commonly in
England and Scotland (since all life is franker and freer in the New
World, especially in the West) than the simple lack of leisure for
study in a community where competition for income drives all men at a
pace that almost seems to belie prosperity. A shrewd and pliable clergy
keeps itself rather better abreast of new scholarship and criticism
than does the mass of the flock; and men and women who first learn from
the pulpit something of the change of view passing over Biblical study
are not apt to turn away from the teacher as Europeans do from an
unteachable priest. But despite all accommodation the sense of an
absolute change is diffused, and there is record of western preachers
bidding farewell to the pulpit and being chorussed by laymen forsaking
the pew.</p>
<p class="par">In strict keeping with the shrinkage of faith among the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>&ldquo;higher&rdquo; races is the expenditure of
effort to spread it among the &ldquo;lower.&rdquo; Faith naturally
seeks the comfort of converts at lower intellectual levels; and it is
in some quarters able to report a certain expansion of territory by
such means. But the total statistics of Protestant missions tell only
of handfuls of converts scattered among the yellow and brown and black
races, a number grotesquely disproportionate to the immense outlay.
This goes on in virtue of the still sufficient wealth of the churches,
which are in consistency bound to respond to missionary appeals while
they profess belief in the Christian doctrine of salvation. It is
found, however, that the missionary system needs, to maintain it,
either an ever more substantial stipend or some other opportunity of
gain to the individual missionary; and the triviality of the results
becomes increasingly discouraging to all save the most fervent faith.
Disparagement of missionary labours on both moral and political grounds
is probably more common among professed churchmen than among
unbelievers, who sometimes, as in the case of Darwin, bear cordial
testimony to the merits and the success of some missionaries as against
the egoism of the normal trader in his relations with the undeveloped
races.</p>
<p class="par">The final problem of Protestantism is its collective
relation to Catholicism; and in the first half of the nineteenth
century many Protestants still hoped to gain ground at the expense of
the Church of Rome, now that propaganda was free. No such success,
however, has taken place. It is found on the contrary that the more
devotional types tend to revert from Protestantism to Rome, while those
who reject Catholicism rarely become Protestants. In France this is
peculiarly apparent. At the Revolution, it was found that
proportionally as many Protestant pastors as Catholic priests were
ready to abjure their creed. In the religious reaction both Churches
alike regained ground; and the Protestant Church in France has always
had adherents distinguished for learning and moral earnestness. To-day,
however, though its members are relatively numerous in places of
political power, by reason doubtless of their serious and practical
education, their Church does not make any corresponding gains. Its
numbers may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>not latterly dwindle as steadily as those of the
Catholic mass; but there is no prospect that it will recover strength
through Catholic defections. In Austria, the anti-Roman movement
already mentioned may conceivably give rise to a non-Romish Church; but
it is impossible to forecast the issue.</p>

Christianity</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is the pride of the Greek Church to call itself
Orthodox; and in no part of Christendom has the faith had less to fear
from unbelief. Mere sectarian strife, indeed, has never been lacking;
and at the very moment of the fall of Constantinople there was deadly
schism between the orthodox and those who were politically willing to
unite with the Latin Church. But vital heresy never throve. Political
vicissitude in the Eastern empire, from Constantine onwards, seems
always to have thrown the balance of force on the side of religious
conservatism; and so devoid is Greek ecclesiastical history since the
Middle Ages of any element of innovating life that the student is
tempted almost to surmise a national loss of faculty. Greek
intellectual life since the fall of Constantinople, however, is only a
steady sequence from that which went before. After the overthrow of the
Latin kingdom set up by the Crusaders, and the restoration of Greek
rule, the whole nation was very naturally thrown back on its
traditions, recoiling from further contact with the West; and the
process of fixation was repeated for what of Greek life was left after
the Turkish conquest. The extraordinary gift for despotic government
shown by the first race of Ottoman Turks brought about a resigned
degradation on the Christian side. Allowed a sufficient measure of
toleration to make them &ldquo;prefer the domination of the Sultan to
that of any Christian potentate,&rdquo; they paid to him not only their
taxes, but, for a time, a large annual tribute of children, with
perfect submission; and thus, in the words of the British historian of
modern Greece, they &ldquo;sank with wonderful rapidity, and without an
effort, into the most abject slavery.&rdquo; Many indeed became
Mohammedans to escape the tribute of children, which after a time
ceased to be exacted, becoming rare in the seventeenth century.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In such circumstances the Christian priesthood and
remaining laity were thrown very closely together, somewhat as happened
in Ireland under English rule, and the result was a perfect devotion on
the part of the Greek peasantry to their creed. It is accordingly
claimed as the force which preserved their nationality. But the
nationality so preserved could not well do much credit to the creed,
which, in turn, gave Greeks a ground of differentiation from their
conquerors without supplying any force of retrieval or progress. What
was secured was not moral union but merely doctrinal persistence in the
state of subjection; and the conqueror &ldquo;availed himself of the
hoary bigotry and infantine vanity of Hellenic dotage to use the Greek
Church as a means of enslaving the nation.&rdquo; The first Sultan
sagaciously appointed a conservative Patriarch, and left Christian
disputes alone. The result was that the Church was kept impotent by its
own quarrels and corruptions. Unity of forms alone remained; simony
&ldquo;became a part of the constitution of the Orthodox Church,&rdquo;
the women of the Sultan&rsquo;s harem selling Christian ecclesiastical
offices; and Christian life as such set up in the Moslem onlookers an
immovable contempt. &ldquo;No more selfish and degraded class of men
has ever held power,&rdquo; says Finlay, &ldquo;than the archonts of
modern Greece and the Phanariots of Constantinople.&rdquo; Greek life
remained at its best in the rural districts, where the old village
governments were allowed to subsist, and where accordingly the people
kept apart from the corrupt and oppressive Turkish law courts. And in
these districts, as it happens, there has been the maximum of pagan
survivals.</p>
<p class="par">The Church in particular exhibited in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, in a worse degree, all the corruption and
backwardness of that of the West in the pre-Reformation period. Greek
monasteries, despite attempts at reform by single emperors, had long
been in large measure places of comfortable retreat for members of the
upper classes; and under Turkish rule they became still more so, acting
however as centres of political intrigue in addition. The result was
that, with every facility for such study as the Benedictines carried on
in the West, the Greek monks as a rule left learning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>alone, and were active chiefly as Turkish
political agents, in the manner of the Western Jesuits. The secular
clergy at the same time became so depressed economically that they were
commonly obliged to work with their hands for a living; and though
those of the country districts were as a rule morally much superior to
those of the towns, all alike were necessarily very ignorant. In the
towns, where many of the aristocracy had become Moslems at the
conquest, both clergy and monks frequently apostatized to Islam, three
cases being recorded in the year 1675; and about that time there is a
curious record of the Turks putting a Christian renegade to death for
cursing his own religion in the divan. Moslems seem always to have
retained a reverence for the Gospel Jesus, considered as apart from his
Church.</p>
<p class="par">It is needless to say that Greek Christianity never had
the slightest countervailing success in converting Moslems. In addition
to the spectacle of Christian degradation constantly under their eyes,
the Turks were in a position to say that no trust could ever be put in
the good faith of a Christian State which made a treaty with them. Thus
even when the usual diseases of despotism and dogmatism corroded the
Turkish polity, the Christians counted for nothing as an element either
of regeneration or of criticism; and no Turk ever looked to their creed
as a possible force of reform, though in the period of energy the
ablest Turkish statesman always saw the wisdom of ruling them
tolerantly, in the Turkish interest, and sought to win them to Islam.
Outside of Greece proper, accordingly, the Greek Church never regained
any ground in the Turkish empire; and in the age of the conquest, when
the expulsion of Jews from Spain drove many of that race to Turkey,
they were everywhere preferred to Christians, whom they ousted,
further, from many industrial and commercial positions in the towns,
becoming the chief bankers, physicians, and merchants, and so helping
to depress the Christians.</p>
<p class="par">No race could under such conditions maintain a high
intellectual life; and among Greek Christians orthodoxy was a matter of
course. While Venice held the Morea at the end of the seventeenth
century, and while Genoa ruled some of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>islands, the same state of things prevailed
under Catholic rule. When accordingly the sense of nationality began to
grow in the eighteenth century, it was from the first associated with
the national religion. In the first quarter of the eighteenth century,
Catholic propaganda was carried on in Chios and elsewhere under French
auspices, and the Greek Church persuaded the Turkish Government to
prohibit proselytism. At no period does the strife between easterns and
westerns at the Holy Sepulchre seem to have ceased; and it now began to
worsen. The wars between Austria and Turkey, however, began the gradual
emancipation of the Greek people from servitude, by putting an outside
pressure on the Turkish Government; the Russians continued the process;
and the new friendly relations now set up between Greek and other
Christians developed a new Greek sentiment of racial hostility to the
Turks. At the same time, the hostility of the Christian powers made the
Porte inclined to attach the Greek upper class by giving them
privileges as Turkish officials, and thus the national self-respect was
on that side further encouraged, despite the corruption of the favoured
class. Probably Russian influence in the eighteenth century did most to
arouse national aspirations, Russia being specially welcome as holding
the Greek form of Christianity; but the Russian attempt to secure
sovereignty as the price of military help checked the movement for
independence; and it needed the contagion of the French revolutionary
movement to cause a vigorous revival. Then Russia on political grounds
combined with the Porte to resist French influence from the Levant and
the Ionian islands; and when in 1815 the revived Ionian Republic was
placed under British protection, Russia and Turkey continued to combine
in jealousy of Western influence.</p>
<p class="par">English rule in the Ionian Islands in turn was
&ldquo;neither wise nor liberal,&rdquo; and while it subsisted did
nothing for Greek development; but it remains the fact that Russia,
holding the Greek creed, never aimed sympathetically at Greek
liberation. That came about at length through the fervour of national
feeling set up at the French Revolution and encouraged by a common
European sympathy, grounded not on religion but on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>admiration for ancient and pagan Greece as the
great exemplar of civilization and intellectual life. The same
admiration for their ancestors was naturally aroused among the Greeks
themselves, and was their strongest political impulse.
&ldquo;Ecclesiastical ties greatly facilitated union, but they neither
created the impulse towards independence, nor infused the enthusiasm
which secured success.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Since the achievement of Greek independence, however,
the people have remained substantially orthodox. Though they are no
longer withheld from intercourse with the West, but have on the
contrary shown a large measure of cosmopolitanism, their intellectual
life has remained relatively fixed till the other day, the new
complacency of independence backing the old complacency of orthodoxy.
An excessive devotion to politics and political intrigue has absorbed
the mental activity of the people; and literary veneration for the
classic past has hampered the free play of intelligence on higher
problems. The &ldquo;Gospel Riots&rdquo; at Athens a dozen years ago
exhibited the state of real culture. On the urging of the Queen there
had been made a translation of the New Testament into the living
language of the people, or into one midway between that and the
artificial academic tongue which has been developed among the literary
class. About that period, however, what appears to be a more truly
vernacular version began to be published in an Athenian journal; and it
was against this that the students and others concerned directed their
indignation, bringing about by their disturbances an actual change of
ministry. Orthodox sentiment and orthodox ignorance appeared to be the
moving forces; so that at the beginning of the twentieth century Greece
could claim to be the most bigoted of Christian countries. Doubtless
the consciousness of possessing the continuous apostolic tradition has
been an important psychological factor in the special conservatism of
belief, as is literary past-worship in the conservatism of speech.</p>
<p class="par">When we turn to Russia, where the creed of the Greek
Church, though under an independent Patriarch, is that of the State, we
find the usual phenomena of European intellectual <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>life
specially marked. In no other country, perhaps, is rationalism or
indifference more nearly universal among the educated class, which is
relatively small; and nowhere is faith more uncritical among the mass.
Among them the use and adoration of icons&mdash;pictures or images of
Jesus or the Madonna or of the saints, embellished in various
ways&mdash;is universal in both private and public devotion; and a
certain number of images, credited with miraculous virtue, earn great
revenues for the monasteries or churches which possess them. The mass
of the parish clergy (who like those of Greece may marry before
ordination, but not a second time) are so ignorant as to be unconcerned
about educated unbelief; and the Church as a whole has little or no
political influence, being thoroughly subject to the political
administration, or at least to the authority of the Tsar.</p>
<p class="par">In the medieval period monasteries in Russia underwent
the same evolution as elsewhere, the monks passing from poverty to
corporate wealth, and owning in particular multitudes of serfs. Their
lands and serfs, however, were secularized in the eighteenth century;
and since then, though some five hundred monasteries continue to exist,
they have counted for little in the national life. Ecclesiastical
discipline has in general been always rigorous under the autocracy; and
in the eighteenth century it was common to flog priests cruelly for
almost any breach of discipline. And though Russia has for ages
abounded in dissenting sects, at no time has any movement of reform
come from the clergy. No Church has been more steadily unintellectual.
All progress in Russia has come from the stimulus of western culture,
beginning under Peter the Great, and continuing throughout the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; and though some men of genius, as
the great novelist, Dostoyevsky, who was anti-rationalist, and Count
Tolstoy, who was heretically religious, have been exceptions to the
rule, the higher Russian culture is predominantly rationalistic. The
greatest Russian novelist, Tourgu&eacute;nief, was a freethinker, as is
Gorky to-day.</p>
<p class="par">The numerous dissident sects of Russia, which represent
in general unorganized developments of the spirit of Bible-worshipping
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>Protestantism, have been broadly classed as
follows: (1) Sects such as the Molokani and Stundists, which found on
the Scriptures, but are not literalists, and resort at times to inward
light for interpretation. (2) Sects which disregard Scripture, and
follow the doctrine of special leaders. (3) Sects which believe in the
re-incarnation of Christ. (4) Sects given to the religion of physical
excitement; some being erotic, as the Jumpers; some flagellant, as the
Khlysti; some fanatically ascetic, as the Skoptsi or Eunuchs. All
alike, however near they may be to orthodoxy, are liable to official
persecution equally with the members of the modern sect of Dukhobortsi,
associated with Count Tolstoy, whose doctrine is non-resistance and
refusal to bear arms. Thus Christianity in Russia is variously
identified with the most medieval formalism and bigotry and the most
exalted enthusiasm for concord; while the march of intelligence
proceeds as far as it may in disregard of all supernaturalist creeds.
But the vast mass of the Russian peasantry stands for the faith of the
Middle Ages, and may now be said to constitute the most religious
section of total Christendom.</p>
<p class="par">Between eastern and western Christianity, finally, there
seems to be no prospect of ecclesiastical fraternization, though hopes
of that kind have been sometimes floated in the Anglican Church. At the
church of the Holy Sepulchre the Greeks and the Latins are in chronic
strife; it was one of their squabbles that brought about the Crimean
War; and in the present year they have shed blood in one of their
scuffles.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4026src" href="#xd21e4026" name=

Influence</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is a deeply significant fact that in recent
times the defence of Christianity takes much more often the form of a
claim that it is socially useful than that of an attempt to prove it
true. The argument from utility is indeed an old one: it is an error to
say, as did J. S. Mill, that men have been little concerned to put it
in competition with the argument from truth; but the former is now in
special favour. Insofar as it proceeds upon a survey of Christian
history it may here be left to the test of confrontation with the
facts; but as it is constantly urged with regard to the actual state of
life and faith, it is necessary to consider it in conclusion.</p>
<p class="par">The chief difficulty in such an inquiry is that the most
irreconcilable formulas are put forth on the side and in the name of
belief. Commonly it is claimed that all that is good in current
morality is derived from Christian sources; that morally scrupulous
unbelievers are so because of their religious training or environment;
and that a removal of the scaffolding of creed will bring to ruin the
edifice of conduct that is held to have been reared by its means. It is
not usually realized that such an argument ends in crediting to
paganism and Judaism the alleged moral merits of the first Christians.
It might indeed be suggested, as against the traditional account of
their pre-eminent goodness, that either they, in turn, owed their
character to their antecedents, or their creed lost its efficacy after
the first generation. But the historic answer to the claim is that
there has never been any such moralizing virtue in the Christian or any
other creed in historically familiar times as need alarm any one for
the moral consequences of its gradual disappearance. All sudden and
revolutionary changes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href=
"#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>in popular moral standards
certainly appear to be harmful; but the great majority of such changes
in the Christian era have been worked under the auspices of faith,
having consisted not in the abandonment of belief, but in the
restatement of ethics in terms of &ldquo;inspiration.&rdquo; Unbelief
proceeds with no such cataclysmic speed. It is not conceivable that the
gradual dissolution of supernaturalist notions will ever of itself work
such evil as is told of in the story of the military evangel of
Christianity in the Dark Ages, the Crusades, the Albigensian massacres,
the conquests of Mexico and Peru, the Anabaptist movement at the outset
of the Reformation, or the massacre of St. Bartholomew, to say nothing
of the death-roll of the Inquisition and the mania against witchcraft.
Even the bloodshed of the Reign of Terror in the French Revolution,
wrought under peculiar political perturbation, was under the auspices
not of atheists but of theists.</p>
<p class="par">If it be asked wherein lies the specific value of dogma
as a moral restraint, in terms of actual observation, there are to be
found no facts that can induce a scientific inquirer to struggle for
the maintenance of a creed believed to be untrue in the hope that it
will prove morally useful. Moral evils may for the purposes of such an
inquiry be broadly classed under the heads of vice, crime, poverty, and
war; and only in regard to the first is there even a plausible pretence
that supernaturalist belief is a preventive. It might indeed seem
likely, on first thought, that a cancelling of supernaturalist vetoes
on the pleasures of the senses may lead to increased indulgence; but
those vetoes apply to all sensual indulgence alike, and no one now
pretends that unbelievers are more given to gluttony and drunkenness
than believers; though the latter may doubtless claim, in respect of
the Catholic Church, to include a larger number of extreme ascetics, as
do the votaries of faiths pronounced by Catholics to be false. While,
then, there may and do arise modifications of the religious formulas of
ethics, there is absolutely no reason to apprehend that any form of
conduct will be less considerate on naturalist than on supernaturalist
principles. The Christian doctrine of forgiveness for sins must do more
to encourage licence than can be done <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb312" href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>by any rationalistic
ethic. Even where naturalism might give a sanction which Christian
dogma withholds, as in the case of suicides, it is not found that any
statistical change is set up by unbelief. Poverty, again, has probably
been normally worse in Christian Europe throughout the whole Christian
era than in any previous or non-Christian civilization; and the most
systematic schemes for its extinction in recent times are of
non-Christian origin, though a personal and habitual effort to modify
the stress of poverty is one of the more creditable features of
organized Christian work. As regards crime, the case is much the same.
The vast majority of criminals hold supernaturalist beliefs, atheism
being extremely rare among them; and while many Christians have in the
past done good and zealous work towards a humane and rational treatment
of criminals, the only scientific and comprehensive schemes now on foot
are framed on naturalist lines, and are denounced by professed
Christians on theological lines, either as being sinfully lenient to
wrongdoing or as being &ldquo;cold-blooded.&rdquo; Thus supernaturalism
remains prone to a cruel and irrational ideal of retribution, even
while some of its champions profess to combat scientific methods in the
name of humanity.</p>
<p class="par">It is in regard to the influence of religious teaching
on international relations, however, that the saddest conclusions are
forced upon the student of Christian history. The foregoing pages have
shown how potent has been organized Christianity to promote strife and
slaughter, how impotent to restrain them. If any instance could be
found in history of a definite prevention of war on grounds of
Christian as distinguished from prudential motive, it would have been
there recorded. So flagrant is the record that when it is cited the
Christian defence veers round from the position above viewed to one
which unconsciously places the source of civilization in human reason.
Yet even thus the historic facts are misstated. The enormity of
Christian strifes in the past is now apologetically accounted for by
the fantastic theorem that hitherto men have not
&ldquo;understood&rdquo; Christianity, and that only in modern times
have its founder&rsquo;s teachings been properly comprehended.
Obviously there has been no such development: the gospel&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>inculcations of love and concord are as simple
as may be, and have at all times been perfectly intelligible: what has
been lacking is the habit of mind and will that secures the fulfilment
of such precepts. And recent experience has painfully proved, once for
all, that the religious or &ldquo;believer&rsquo;s&rdquo; temper,
instead of being normally conducive to such action, is normally the
worst hindrance to it.</p>
<p class="par">An explanation is to be found in a study of the normal
results of guiding conduct by emotional leanings rather than by
critical reflection. The former is peculiarly the process of
evangelical religion. Hence comes the practical inefficacy of a love of
peace derived either inertly through acceptance of a form of words
declared to be sacred, or through an emotional assent to such words
emotionally propounded. Emotions so evolved are of the surface, and are
erased as easily as they are induced, by stronger emotions proceeding
from the animal nature. Only a small minority of Christians,
accordingly, are found to resist the rush of warlike passions; and some
who call most excitedly for peace when there is no war are found among
those most excited by the war passion as soon as the contagion stirs.
It may be noted as a decisive fact in religious history that in regard
to the war which raged while these pages were first being
penned,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4060src" href="#xd21e4060" name=
"xd21e4060src">1</a> the movement of critical opposition and
expostulation succeeded almost in the ratio of men&rsquo;s remoteness
from the Christian faith. Among the Quaker sect, so long honourably
distinguished by its testimony against war, there was a considerable
reversion to the normal temper, as if the old conviction had been in
many cases lost in the process of merely hereditary transmission. Among
the Christian Churches so called, by far the most peace-loving is the
Unitarian, which rejects the central Christian dogma. And among the
public men associated with the protest against the war, the number
known to be rationalists was proportionally as large as that of the
supernaturalists was small. The personal excellence and elevation of
moral feeling shown among the latter group is thus no warrant for
seeing the cause in their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href=
"#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>creed. In such matters there is no
invariable rule, every section exhibiting psychical divergence within
itself; but it is now statistically clear that the standing claim for
the conventional creed as being peculiarly helpful to the cause of
peace is false. The title of &ldquo;Bible-loving&rdquo; had for a
generation been applied to England by its pietists. The same title is
confessedly applicable to the Boers of South Africa. Yet no
consciousness of a common creed ever availed to restrain the hatred of
the Christian mass in England towards their &ldquo;enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The recent history of the near East conveys a similar
lesson. For generations the Turkish autocracy was able to keep down the
Christian peoples under its rule by means of their mutual hates. It was
not community of religion that brought about the Balkan and Greek
combination of 1912: it was military and political calculation; and the
overthrow of Turkey was no sooner completed than the Christian
combatants were on the verge of war with each other. Between Greek and
Bulgarian there seems to be to-day the same animosity as existed in the
Dark Ages; and Greek orthodoxy declaims against the
&ldquo;irreligion&rdquo; of educated Bulgaria, while the mass of the
Bulgarian people remains as superstitious as that of Greece. As regards
standards of conduct, the former seem to have capped every savagery of
which Turkish irregulars have ever been guilty. Whatever may be the
outcome of freedom for self-development in the light of western
civilization, there is plainly nothing to choose as between Christian
and Moslem moral material in those regions after two thousand years of
Christianity. Such facts bring out once for all the sociological truth
as to the part played by Christianity in civilization. The progress of
the more advanced States has not been caused by creed. If that were the
lifting factor, Abyssinia should be on the same plane with the leading
European States. Once more, it is not Christianity that has civilized
modern Europe, but the variously caused and conditioned progress of
Europe that has civilized Christianity; even as the conditions and
forces of ancient Hellas civilized its paganism.</p>
<p class="par">Such tests are of course not those that will be first
put by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>a scrupulous mind seeking to know whether the
Christian creed be true. Rather they are forced on such a mind by the
tactics of believers, who as a rule seek to evade the fundamental
issue. It is not unlikely, therefore, in view of present painful
experience, that for some time to come the stress of defence will shift
to the attempt, never entirely abandoned, to defend the faith on
evidential or philosophic grounds. We have thus to consider finally the
apparent effects of Christian credences and institutions on the
intellectual life of the time.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">&sect; 2.</span> <i>Intellectual
Influence</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">So far as it can be historically traced, the
intellectual influence of Christianity was relatively at its best when
it began to be propounded as a creed in critical relation to Judaism.
Intellectual gain was checked as soon as it became a substantive creed,
demanding submissive acceptance. From that point forward it becomes a
restraint on intellectual freedom, save insofar as it stirred believers
to a one-sided criticism of pagan beliefs, a process of which the
educational effect was promptly annulled by a veto on its extension to
the beliefs of the critics. It has been argued indeed that modern
science has been signally advanced by the mental bias that goes with
monotheism; but the historical fact is that Jewish monotheism was much
less friendly to science than Babylonian polytheism; that the
beginnings of Greek science were among polytheists and, perhaps,
atheists; that Saracen monotheism owed its scientific stimulus to the
recovered thought of polytheistic Greece; and that, whatever impulse a
truly monotheistic philosophy may have given to modern science, the
usual influence of Christian belief has been to override the idea of
invariable causation in nature. Even after the belief in recurrent
miracles is disavowed, the doctrine and practice of prayer remain to
represent the old concept.</p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, the kind of violence done to the
instinct for concrete or historical truth by the frauds and delusions
of the early and medieval Church, though greatly attenuated in modern
times, has never ended. Critical judgment has only slowly recovered the
strength and stature <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"
name="pb316">316</a>]</span>it had in the pre-Christian world; and
wherever faith has plenary rule such judgment is liable to arbitrary
interdict. It is true that even in the nineteenth century some great
servants of science have been either orthodox Christians or devout
theists. Faraday and Joule, Pasteur and Kelvin, are cases in point. But
instead of the religious creed having in such cases furnished the cue
or the motive to the scientific work done, it is found to be out of all
logical relation to it, and to be a mere obstruction to the scientific
use of the reason on the religious problem itself.</p>
<p class="par">To a considerable extent the rigid adherence to
religious beliefs or professions in defiance of evidence is on all
fours with any other form of conservatism, as the social and the
political. Inasmuch, however, as religion proffers both a specific
comfort in this life and a specific reward in another, it has a power
of intellectual fixation with which no other can compare; and there is
something unique in the spectacle of religious doctrines kept in an
unchanged form by means of an economic basis consecrated to them. It
has been seen in the foregoing history that for two thousand years no
creed with such a basis has been overthrown either wholly or locally
save by a force which confiscated its endowments or suppressed its
worship. Thus, and thus only, did Christianity triumph over southern
and northern paganism; thus did Islam triumph over Christianity in
parts of its world, and fall again before it in others; and thus did
Protestantism expel Catholicism from many countries and suffer
expulsion in turn from some of them. Where endowments can subsist, with
freedom of worship, no form of doctrine that is wedded to the
endowments ever yields directly to criticism.</p>
<p class="par">Christianity has thus had in the modern world a
relatively more sinister influence on the intellectual life than was
wrought by any phase of paganism even in periods when the intelligence
of the ancient world was divorced from its established religion. The
divorce is now more complete than ever before; but the bribe to
conformity is greater than ever, relatively at least to the light of
the time. The result is a maximum of insincerity, whether or not the
bribe is given by a standing endowment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>Dissenting or
voluntary churches in the Protestant countries offer an income to more
or less educated men on condition of propounding the creed of the past;
and the more intelligent minority within the churches are weighed down
in every effort at a modification of doctrine by the orthodoxy of the
uncritical or fanatical many, who control the endowments. Social and
commercial life conform to the conditions, and everywhere the
profession of belief is far in excess of the actuality&mdash;a state of
things unfavourable to all morality. The very attempt to adjust the
system to the pressure of modern thought exhibits the process of
demoralization. From the clergy we have neither straightforward defence
nor straightforward avowal of old error. Christianity is defended not
as being true but as being socially useful and privately comforting;
and a general pretence is made of maintaining the continuity of a
historic creed whose central and fundamental dogmas are no longer held
save by the most uncritical.</p>
<p class="par">It is not only in religion and ethics that the influence
of endowed and organized Christianity is thus intellectually baneful.
Every science in turn, from the days of Galileo, has had to fight for
its life against the sanctified ignorance of all the churches; and
while the physical sciences, which can be taught without open reference
to traditional error, have carried their point and received endowment
in turn, happily without being tied down to any documents, the moral
sciences are either kept in tutelage to theology in the universities of
many countries, our own included, or forced to leave out of their scope
the phenomena of religion itself, and in particular the sociological
problem of Christian history. At the beginning of the present century
there was not a single chair of sociology in a British
university<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4094src" href="#xd21e4094" name=
"xd21e4094src">2</a>; and even in the United States, where such chairs
are common, they and the historical chairs alike are barred from any
free treatment of religious evolution. Ethical teaching is similarly
limited; and a science which on that side threatened to turn the flank
of religious doctrine&mdash;to wit, phrenology&mdash;was at an early
stage of its progress in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href=
"#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>first half of the nineteenth
century successfully ostracized, so that, lacking the expert handling
without which no science can be kept sound, it has been relegated even
for most naturalists to the limbo of exploded error, without ever
having been scientifically developed or confuted.</p>
<p class="par">In fine, the science of society, the most momentous of
all, is by reason of the very nature of organized religion kept in
trammels, lest it should undermine the reign of faith. It makes its way
in virtue of the whole scientific movement of the age, and is perhaps
most progressive in the countries where, as in France and Italy, an
official Catholicism has prevented the academic compromise between
faith and science which is effected in the Protestant world, but is
powerless to keep independent science out of the universities. In those
countries, however, there are compromises of other kinds; and in modern
France there has been seen, in the case of Captain Dreyfus, the
spectacle of the clerical influence combining with that of the army to
enforce an insensate act of injustice, less from any intelligent motive
of a direct bearing than for the sake of a general alliance in which
each of the two great conservative and anti-progressive institutions
backs the other for general reactionary ends. Thus religious feeling
abets social and political malice; and such movements as that of
anti-Semitism, fostered by Christian organizations, can secure support
from others as the price of clerical support.</p>
<p class="par">As a result of its autocratic and centralized system,
further, Catholicism is a special force of political conservatism in
Catholic countries, with the single exception of Ireland, where its
dependence on the mass of the people has thus far kept it in close
alliance with their nationalist movement in despite of any papal
restrictions. Such an alliance is of course unfavourable to
intellectual progress on other lines; and English Protestant policy,
largely directed by sectarian feeling, has thus preserved in Ireland
the type of Catholicism it fears. Such Catholicism still tends to
retard popular education; and the one general advantage the Protestant
countries can claim over the Catholic is their lower degree of
illiteracy. On the other hand, the rationalism of the more enlightened
Catholic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>countries, where the Church lacks official
power, is as a rule more explicit, more awake to the nature of the
force opposed to it; while in Protestant Germany it is little concerned
to oppose a Church with small organized or academic influence, and till
lately attempted little popular criticism of faith. Every country thus
presents some special type of intellectual harm or drawback resulting
from the presence of organized Christianity; and in all alike it makes
in varying degrees an obstacle to light.</p>
<p class="par">In the highest degree does this seem to be true of the
land where it has had the longest continuous life. Alone among the
nations Greece contributes nothing to the world&rsquo;s renovation.
Italy, despite the papacy, has a swarm of eager and questioning
thinkers, working at the human sciences; Spain stirs under all the
leaden folds of clericalism; but Greece, where the faith has never
undergone eclipse since Justinian&rsquo;s day, remains intellectually
almost Byzantine, vainly divided between Christian dogma and an
external classic tradition, neither ancient nor modern. Yet this is the
one European country where belief is ostensibly untroubled by its
enemy. It is hard to say how far the surface of orthodoxy conforms to
the mental life underneath; but there is no escape from the conclusion
that a new mental life can return to the land of Aristotle only in the
measure in which it fully readmits from the West the spirit of search
and challenge which he and Socrates left to re-inspire a world growing
moribund under the spell of faith.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">&sect; 3.</span> <i>Conclusion
and Prognosis</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It follows from the foregoing history and survey
that Christianity, regarded by its adherents as either the one
progressive and civilizing religion or the one most helpful to progress
and civilization, is in no way vitally different from the others which
have a theistic basis, and is in itself neither more nor less a force
of amelioration than any other founding on sacred books and
supernaturalist dogmas. Enlightened Christians with progressive
instincts have justified them in terms of Christian doctrine, even as
enlightened Moslems, Brahmans, and Buddhists have justified their
higher ideals in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320"
name="pb320">320</a>]</span>terms of their doctrine; and the special
fortune of Christianity has lain in this, that after nearly a thousand
years in which it was relatively retrograde as compared with Islam,
which during a large part of the time was progressive, both being what
they were in virtue of institutions and environment, the environment
was so far politically changed that the Christian countries gradually
progressed, while the Moslem countries lost ground. To-day it is
becoming clear to instructed eyes that the faiths were not the causal
forces; and in Asia the rapid development of Japan in the past
generation has vividly demonstrated the fallacy of the Christian view.
As there was great progress under ancient paganism, under each one of
the great creeds or cults of Asia, under Islam, and under Christianity,
so there may be much greater progress in the absence of them all, in
virtue of a wider knowledge, a more scientific polity, and a more
diffused culture.</p>
<p class="par">The ultimate problem is to forecast the future. A
confident faith in continual progress is one of the commonest states of
mind of the present, the consciously scientific age; and in view of the
unmistakable decadence of the creeds as such, it is natural to
rationalists to expect an early reduction of Christianity to the status
now held by &ldquo;folk-lore,&rdquo; a species of survival dependent on
ignorance upon the one hand and antiquarian curiosity on the other. But
while this may be called probable, there can be no scientific certainty
in the matter. For one thing, the process must for economic reasons be
much slower than used to be thought likely, for instance, in the time
of Voltaire, who allowed a century for the extinction of the Christian
creed. Voltaire was so far right that a century has seen Christianity
abandoned, after a reaction, by a large part of the best intelligence
of our age, as it was by that of his. But there may be more reactions;
and there is always a conceivable possibility of a total decadence,
such as overtook the civilization of the old Mediterranean world.</p>
<p class="par">The question is at bottom one of political science.
Greek and Roman civilization failed primarily through the incapacity of
the ancient States to set up a polity of international peace,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>secondarily through the effects of the military
despotism which that failure superinduced. As the problem is all of a
piece, avoidance of the old error will presumably mean avoidance of the
old doom. A similar political failure in the modern world would in all
likelihood mean the same sequence of military imperialism, possibly
with better economic management, but with the same phenomena of
intellectual decline and reversion to fanaticism and superstition among
populations debarred from political activity and free speech. It is
indeed dimly conceivable that, as has been suggested by way of fiction,
the mere warfare of capital and labour may end in the degradation of
the people, and the consequent reduction of upper-class life to the
plane of mere sensuous gratification and &ldquo;practical&rdquo;
science. In either event, a religion now seen by instructed men to be
incredible may be preserved by a community neither instructed nor
religious.</p>
<p class="par">The hope of the cause of reason then lies with the
political ideals and movements which best promise to save democracy and
to elevate the mass. It is hopefully significant that, as we have seen,
the most systematic and scientific of these movements are pronouncedly
rationalistic; and it is safe to say that their ultimate success
depends on their rationalism. All past movements for the social
salvation of the mass have failed for lack of social science; and
dogmatic Christianity in its most humane and sympathetic forms remains
the negation of such science. What is called &ldquo;Christianity
without dogma&rdquo; is merely humane sentiment misnamed.</p>
<p class="par">It is essential to a durable advance, however, that it
should be pure of violence, and utterly tolerant. When popular
education has emptied all or any of the churches, as it has already
gone some way towards doing, the spontaneous revenue of those which are
voluntary bodies will in the main have ceased; and by that time the
majority will be in a position to dispose of national funds in the
social interest. Such a course will be facile to a society which
provides work for all and sustains all; and when the bribe of sectarian
endowment is thus made void, the more factitious life of ancient error
will be at an end. But the most speculative construction of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>future provides for the widest individual and
psychological freedom; and there will have been no true triumph of
reason if philosophic and historic error, recognized as such, have not
a free field. The Utopia of rationalism will be reached when
supernaturalism in the present sense of the term shall have passed away
as the belief in witchcraft has done, without pressure of pains and
penalties. And that Utopia will be the rendezvous, belike, of more than
one social ideal&mdash;of all, indeed, which trust to reason for the
attainment of righteousness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href=

<p class="par first">A good introduction to the rational discussion of
the whole problem of origins is furnished in <i>Radical Views about the
New Testament</i>, by Dr. G. A. van den Bergh van Eysinga, trans. from
the Dutch by S. B. Slack (R. P. A., 1912). The Unitarian view is
freshly put by Wilhelm Soltau in <i>The Birth of Jesus Christ</i> (Eng.
tr., Black, 1903). Of the countless works discussing early Christian
literature and the formation of the New Testament &ldquo;Canon,&rdquo;
the following may be consulted with profit: All relevant articles in
the <i lang="la">Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i> (A. &amp; C. Black);
<i>Supernatural Religion: An Inquiry into the Reality of Divine
Revelation</i>, 6th ed. revised, 1875, two vols.; 3rd vol. 1877; R. P.
A. rep. in one vol., 1902; <i>A Reply to Dr. Lightfoot&rsquo;s
Essays</i>, by the same author, 1889; <i>An Introduction to the Study
of the New Testament</i>, by Dr. Samuel Davidson, 2nd ed. revised,
1882, two vols.; <i>The Apostolical Fathers</i>, by Dr. James
Donaldson, 1874 and later; Renan&rsquo;s preface to his <i>Saint
Paul</i>, the Appendice to his <i lang=

&Eacute;vangiles</i>; E. B. Nicholson&rsquo;s compilation, <i>The
Gospel According to the Hebrews</i>, 1879; <i>History of the Canon in
the Christian Church</i>, by Professor Reuss, Eng. tr. 1890;
<i>Apostolical Records of Early Christianity</i>, by the Rev. Dr.
Giles, 1886; Strauss&rsquo;s second <i lang="de">Leben Jesu</i>, tr. in
Eng. (not always accurately) as <i>A New Life of Jesus</i>, 2nd ed.
1879, two vols.; and the old research of Lardner on <i>The Credibility
of the Gospels</i> (Part II, ch. i to xxix in vol. ii of <i>Works</i>,
ed. 1835) which covers the ground pretty fully, indeed diffusely. As to
the Pauline epistles see Van Manen&rsquo;s article in the <i lang=
"la">Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i>, and T. Whittaker&rsquo;s
<i>Origins of Christianity</i> (R. P. A., 1909). The most comprehensive
account of the early sources is Harnack&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Geschichte
der altchristlichen Literatur bis Eusebius</i> (1893) in two great
volumes; and the still bulkier <i lang="de">Chronologie</i> which
follows thereon. More compendious surveys are Professor Gustav
Kr&uuml;ger&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Geschichte der altchristlichen
Literatur in den ersten drei Jahrhunderten</i>, 1895; and Dr. James
Donaldson&rsquo;s <i>History of Christian Literature and Doctrine</i>,
three vols., 1864&ndash;66. Of real value is the survey of Professor
Arnold Meyer, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=

<p class="par first">The sources as to the Nazarenes and Ebionites are
given by Bishop Lightfoot in his ed. of the Epistle to the Galatians,
p. 298, ff. (diss. reprinted in <i>Dissertations on the Apostolic
Age</i>, 1892, p. 74, ff.); also in W. R. Sorley&rsquo;s <i>Jewish
Christians and Judaism</i>, 1881, p. 66, ff. Both proceed on the
traditional assumptions. Critical discrimination between the Ebionites
and &ldquo;Nazarenes&rdquo; begins in modern times with Mosheim,
<i lang="la">Vindicia Antiqu&aelig; Christianorum Disciplin&aelig;

"la">Commentarium de rebus Christianorum ante Constantinum</i>, 1753,
S&aelig;c. II, &sect; xxxix (Eng. tr. vol. ii, p. 194, ff.). His
position was developed by Gieseler (1828), and has become the basis of
later ecclesiastical historiography, as in the above-cited writers, and
in Weizs&auml;cker&rsquo;s <i>Apostolic Age</i>. A new and more
searching analysis of the phenomena, on lines previously suggested but
not developed, is made by P. Hochart in his <i lang="fr">&Eacute;tudes
d&rsquo;histoire religieuse</i>, 1890, chs. iv and v. For the positions
of the present section, in so far as they are not there fully reasoned,
the grounds will be found in the author&rsquo;s <i>Christianity, and
Mythology</i>, Part III, 1st Div. &sect; 9, and in the <i>National
Reformer</i>, 1888, March 18 and 25, April 1, 8, and 15. On the
Nazareth problem see Dr. Cheyne&rsquo;s article in the <i lang=

paper on <i>The Syriac Forms of New Testament Proper Names</i> (in

<p class="par first">Of the more rationalistic Lives of Jesus,
so-called, that of Renan is the most charming and the least scientific;
those by Strauss the most systematic and educative; that of Thomas
Scott, &ldquo;The English Life of Jesus,&rdquo; the most compendious
view of the conflicts of the gospel narratives. Evan Meredith&rsquo;s
<i>Prophet of Nazareth</i> (1864) is rather a stringent criticism of
the whole Christian system of ethics, evidences, and theology
(rejecting supernaturalism but assuming a historical Christ) than a
scientific search for a personality behind the Gospels. It however
passes many acute criticisms. Later German Lives of Christ, such as
those of Keim and B. Weiss, are useful in respect of their scholarly
comprehensiveness, but have little final critical value. A more
advanced stage of documentary criticism than is seen in any of these is
reached in the second section of the article <i>Gospels</i>, by
Professor Schmiedel, in the <i lang="la">Encyclop&aelig;dia

process of elimination yet further are developed in the author&rsquo;s

Christian Church is dealt with by the late Dr. Edwin Hatch, in his
<i>Influence of Greek Ideas and Usages upon the Christian Church</i>,
1890; and some of the relations between the Jewish Passover and
coincident pagan feasts are suggested in the valuable old treatise of
J. Spencer, <i lang="la">De Legibus Hebr&aelig;orum</i> (1685 and

<p class="par first">The early and bitter strife between the Jewish and
Gentile parties in the Christist movement was first exhaustively
studied by the T&uuml;bingen school. See the important works of its
founder, F. C. Baur, <i lang="de">Das Christenthum und die christliche
Kirche der drei ersten Jahrhunderte</i>, 1853 (Eng. tr. <i>The Church
History of the First Three Centuries</i>, 1878, two vols.) and <i lang=

Zeller on the <i>Contents and Origin of the Acts of the Apostles</i>
(Eng. tr. two vols. 1875, with Overbeck&rsquo;s Introduction to the
Acts, from De Wette&rsquo;s <i>Handbook</i>). Compare the somewhat more
conservative treatise of Weizs&auml;cker, <i>The Apostolic Age of the
Christian Church</i>, Eng. tr. two vols. 1894, and the orthodox
Neander&rsquo;s <i>History of the Planting and Training of the
Christian Church by the Apostles</i> (Eng. tr. two vols. 1851), where
however some decisive admissions are made as to the narrative of the
Acts. One of the most comprehensive surveys of the documentary
discussion is J. J&uuml;ngst&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Die Quellen der
Apostelgeschichte</i> (Gotha, 1895). Some interesting concessions are
made by Professor Ramsay in his work on <i>The Church and the Roman
Empire before A.D. 170</i> (1893). On the Gentile parallels discussed
consult Frazer&rsquo;s <i>Golden Bough</i> and Havet&rsquo;s <i lang=
"fr">Le Christianisme et ses origines</i>. The questions raised by the
vogue of the term &ldquo;Chr&#275;stos&rdquo; are well set forth and
discussed in the brochure of the late Dr. J. Barr Mitchell,
<i>Chr&#275;stos: A Religious Epithet, its Import and Influence</i>
(Williams and Norgate, 1880). Compare Renan, <i>Saint Paul</i>, p. 363,
and refs. Various aspects of the general problem are set forth in the
<i>Monumental Christianity</i> of J. P. Lundy (New York, 1876). For a
full view of Gnosticism see Baur, <i lang="de">Die Christliche
Gnosis</i>, 1835, and C. W. King, <i>The Gnostics and their
Remains</i>, 2nd ed. 1887; and for a survey of Samaritan tenets see J.

his <i>Diss. Misc.</i>, Pars I, 1706. A view of the ancient practices
of cutting and gashing in the presence of the dead, etc., is given in
John Spencer&rsquo;s treatise <i lang="la">De Legibus
Hebr&aelig;orum</i>, lib. ii. cc. 13, 14. The Myth of Simon Magus was

<p class="par first">Dr. Hatch&rsquo;s <i>Organization of the Early
Christian Churches</i> recognizes, on nominally orthodox principles,
the fact that the structure was a natural adaptation to environment, on
old type-lines. Of the movement of Apollonius of Tyana, good accounts
are given by Professor A. R&eacute;ville, <i>Apollonius of Tyana, the
Pagan Christ of the Third Century</i>, Eng. tr. 1866; by Mr. T.
Whittaker in his <i>Apollonius of Tyana, and other Essays</i>
(Sonnenschein, 1906); and in the essay of Baur in his <i lang="de">Drei

research, usually fair, and gives light on the previous reigns, as well
as on Julian&rsquo;s. Gibbon&rsquo;s survey here remains important. On
Gregory of Nazianzun there is a monograph by Ullmann (Eng. tr. 1851).

<p class="par first">As to the physical sciences, compare White, Baden
Powell, Whewell, and Draper, as above cited; also Draper&rsquo;s
<i>Conflict between Religion and Science</i> (Internat. Lib. of
Science); and the series of Histories of the Sciences published by the
R. P. A. On the development of philosophy, cosmic and moral, and of
Biblical Criticism, see the references in the author&rsquo;s <i>Short
History of Freethought</i>. A specially full and illuminating study of
modern thought is made in Mr. A. W. Benn&rsquo;s <i>History of English
Rationalism in the Nineteenth Century</i> (two vols. Longmans, 1906).

<p class="par first">For the history of Catholicism since the
seventeenth century consult Mosheim and Neander, also the <i>History of
the Fall of the Jesuits</i>, by Count A. de Saint-Priest (Eng. tr.
1845), and Mr. Joseph McCabe&rsquo;s <i>The Decay of the Church of
Rome</i> (1909). There is an extensive literature on the controversy
between Anglicanism and Catholicism in the middle of the nineteenth
century, following on the Tractarian movement, as to the latest phases
of which see the <i>Secret History of the Oxford Movement</i>, by
Walter Walsh. For references as to recent developments in Protestant
and other countries see again the author&rsquo;s <i>Short History of
Freethought</i> and Mr. Benn&rsquo;s full record of the nineteenth
century. The fortunes of Greek Christianity may be traced through
Finlay. Compare Villemain, <i lang="fr">Essai sur l&rsquo;&eacute;tat
des Grecs depuis la conqu&ecirc;te musulmane</i>, in his <i lang=
"fr">&Eacute;tudes d&rsquo;histoire moderne</i> (<span lang="fr">nouv.
ed. 1846</span>). Concerning the state of religion in modern Russia,
see Wallace&rsquo;s <i>Russia</i>. As to missions in general, see the
able and comprehensive survey, <i>Foreign Missions</i>, by C. Cohen
(Freethought Publishing Company), and <i>A Chinese Appeal to
Christendom Concerning Christian Missions</i> (R.P.A., 1912). The
existing situation as between Christianity and rationalism is well set
forth in Philip Vivian&rsquo;s <i>The Churches and Modern Thought</i>
(R.P.A., 1911). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339"

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
